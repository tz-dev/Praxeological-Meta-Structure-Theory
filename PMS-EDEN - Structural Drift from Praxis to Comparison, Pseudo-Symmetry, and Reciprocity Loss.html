			<h3>0.1 Abstract</h3>
			<p>This paper reconstructs <em>Eden</em> as a <strong>praxeological ground state</strong>: a structurally complete configuration of praxis in which differentiation <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, framing <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>, and temporality <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> are present <strong>without deficit pressure</strong>. Against dominant readings, Eden is neither a state of naivety nor an epistemically impoverished condition. It is a setting in which <strong>Awareness A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time; formally A = [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)])</strong> is structurally available within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>, such that <em>maturity</em> is not absent but stabilized as <strong>A-availability</strong>.</p>
			<p>The so-called “Fall” is analyzed not as an acquisition of knowledge, nor as a moral transgression, but as a <strong>structural interruption of an operator chain</strong> within the PMS operator set <strong>Δ–Ψ (difference through self-binding)</strong>. Crucially: <strong>knowledge ≠ sin, and sin ≠ knowledge</strong>. The decisive act does not generate insight, wisdom, or differentiation <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>. Instead, it activates a <strong>consequence field</strong> in which <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong>, <strong>Θ (temporality: irreversibility over time)</strong>, and <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> become <strong>irreversibly legible</strong>. In this sense, the breach “teaches nothing”: a consciously chosen mis-enactment yields no epistemic surplus, only consequences that were structurally anticipable under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> beforehand.</p>
			<p>On this basis, the paper develops Eden as a minimal test scene for understanding the <strong>genesis of social asymmetries Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong>, the drift toward <strong>pseudo-symmetry</strong> (rhetorical equality under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>), the dynamics of <strong>post-feminist over-steering</strong> (a regime-level configuration of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> control), and the resulting <strong>loss of reciprocity</strong> (failure of <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>). This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution. The analysis is strictly praxeological: it introduces no moral law, no anthropology, and no exegetical claims. Eden functions exclusively as <em>text-as-praxis</em>—a structurally economical setting in which the emergence of contemporary asymmetry patterns can be traced with maximal clarity.</p>
			<h3>0.2 PMS Reference</h3>
			<p>This paper is fully grounded in the <strong>Praxeological Meta-Structure (PMS)</strong>, schema version <strong>PMS_1.1</strong>, operating exclusively within the established operator set <strong>Δ–Ψ (difference through self-binding)</strong>. No operator is added, removed, or reinterpreted. All structural claims are expressed as compositions, absences, or failures of these operators.</p>
			<p>The term <strong>“sin”</strong> is employed solely as a <strong>historical alias</strong> for a specific praxeological configuration: a <strong>conscious praxis breach under Awareness A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time; formally A = [Θ (temporality: trajectory/time), □ (frame: contextual constraint), Δ (difference: minimal distinction)])</strong>—i.e. enactment under <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> with <strong>A (awareness)</strong> present, but <strong>without Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> and without <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> carrying the enactment (Ψ absent, failed, externalized, or simulated). It carries no theological, moral, or metaphysical weight within this paper and can be replaced everywhere by its structural description <strong>without changing the substantive content</strong>.</p>
			<p>All <strong>applications</strong> of PMS (prescribing, binding, obligating, demanding) remain subject to the PMS entry condition stated below (Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)). This entry condition applies to application, not to critique or rejection.</p>
			<p>Authoritative references:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>PMS repository: <a href="https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory">https://github.com/tz-dev/Praxeological-Meta-Structure-Theory</a></li>

			</ul>
			<p>All interpretations in PMS–EDEN are constrained by the formal definitions, dependencies, and guardrails of PMS as specified therein.</p>
			<h3>0.3 Entry Condition (Validity Clause)</h3>
			<p>PMS distinguishes sharply between <strong>description</strong> and <strong>application</strong>. Accordingly, this paper adopts the PMS_1.1 entry condition as a validity clause:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>PMS entry condition (application validity):</strong> Any <strong>application</strong> of PMS (prescribing, binding, obligating, demanding) presupposes acceptance of <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of Ω (asymmetry) via self-restraint)</strong>.<br>This condition applies to <strong>application</strong>, not to critique or rejection. Applications that suspend these conditions are <strong>formally invalid as PMS</strong>, even if PMS vocabulary is used.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Description remains valid:</strong> PMS–EDEN may describe configurations in which <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> is absent, weak, or instrumentalized, without becoming invalid as description. The entry condition is not a truth criterion and not a requirement for naming.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Where “binding” begins:</strong> PMS becomes <em>binding</em> only at the point where a description is used to <strong>steer, obligate, enforce, or morally bind</strong> agents or roles—i.e. where <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is imposed or claimed as obligation, especially as <strong>Ψ→Other (externalized binding: “you must …” demand imposed on the other)</strong> rather than adopted as <strong>Ψ→Self (self-binding: adopting the commitment as one’s own)</strong>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This clause prevents a category error: confusing structural analysis with normative imposition. PMS–EDEN analyzes failure modes, asymmetries <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong>, and drifts even where reflective distance <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is missing; it does not thereby legitimize their enforcement.</p>
			<h3>0.4 Scope &amp; Guardrails</h3>
			<p>The scope of PMS–EDEN is deliberately narrow and explicitly bounded:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Non-theological</strong>: Eden is treated as <em>text-as-praxis</em>, not as revelation, doctrine, or metaphysical origin.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-psychological</strong>: No mental states, traits, intentions, or pathologies are inferred.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-normative</strong>: The paper derives no “ought”, no moral injunction, and no prescriptive ethics.</li>
				<li><strong>Non-person-evaluative</strong>: Individuals are never assessed, ranked, or diagnosed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>All references to <strong>“Man”</strong> and <strong>“Woman”</strong> denote <strong>praxis roles or default structural configurations under Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong>, not biological essences, psychological dispositions, or moral types. Claims are structural and probabilistic, not ontological.</p>
			<p>These guardrails are not defensive add-ons; they are constitutive of PMS methodology.</p>
			<h3>0.5 Spec-Conformance Box</h3>
			<h4>Notation convention (paper-wide)</h4>
			<p>This paper uses the following conventions for operator and axis notation:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Component lists:</strong> Square brackets <code>[...]</code> denote <strong>component availability</strong> (the listed operators are structurally present as the axis’ components).<br>Example: <strong>A = [Θ, □, Δ]</strong> means Awareness is the structural availability of temporality, frame, and difference.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Operator composition:</strong> The composition symbol <code>∘</code> is used only where <strong>ordered application</strong> is intended (rare in this paper’s frontmatter; used mainly for fixpoints or explicit operator chains).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>No “+” shorthand:</strong> To avoid ambiguity between “addition” and “composition,” this paper does <strong>not</strong> use <code>+</code> for axis definitions. All ACRED axis formulas are expressed as component lists <code>[...]</code> consistent with PMS_1.1.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>To ensure full compatibility with <strong>PMS_1.1</strong>, the following clarifications apply throughout the paper (definitions are <strong>structural</strong>, non-phenomenological, and non-clinical):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>PMS entry condition (application validity):</strong>
						Any <strong>application</strong> of PMS (prescribing, binding, obligating, demanding) presupposes acceptance of
						<strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong>.
						This condition applies to <strong>application</strong>, not to critique or rejection. Uses that suspend these conditions are
						<strong>formally invalid as PMS</strong>, even if PMS vocabulary is used.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>ACRED (derived axes) are paper-wide reference definitions (operator-conform):</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Awareness A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time):</strong>
							<strong>A = [Θ (temporality: trajectory/time), □ (frame: contextual constraint), Δ (difference: minimal distinction)]</strong>.
							Awareness denotes operator availability (sustained framed differentiation), not phenomenology.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Coherence C (coherence: temporally stabilized impulse/expectation structuring within a frame):</strong>
							<strong>C = [Θ (temporality: trajectory/time), Λ (non-event: structured absence), □ (frame: contextual constraint), ∇ (impulse: directed tension)]</strong>.
							Coherence is a structural stability notion, not a psychological “state.”
						</li>
						<li><strong>Responsibility R (responsibility: self-binding orientation toward asymmetry across time and recontextualization):</strong>
							<strong>R = [Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment), Φ (recontextualization: frame shift), Θ (temporality: trajectory/time), Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)]</strong>.
							Responsibility is modeled structurally (position/time/binding), not as moral judgement or trait inference.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Action / Enactment E (action: integrated enactment):</strong>
							<strong>E = [Σ (integration: coherence synthesis), Θ (temporality: trajectory/time), ∇ (impulse: directed tension)]</strong>.
							Enactment without Σ/Ψ carriage is treated as realization/enactment, not E (action) in the strict PMS sense.
						</li>
						<li><strong>Dignity-in-practice D (restrained handling of asymmetry):</strong>
							<strong>D = (Ψ ∘ Χ) applied to Ω-handling</strong> (i.e., self-bound reflective restraint in asymmetrical relations).
							D is not a metaphysical worth claim; it is a structural constraint on enacted restraint and protection under asymmetry.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) is not knowledge:</strong>
						<strong>Χ</strong> denotes withdrawal/inhibition that preserves revision capacity; it is a condition for binding validity, not a truth criterion.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>No deviation from these definitions occurs anywhere in PMS–EDEN.</p>

			<p><strong>Consequence-language guard (non-normativity):</strong>
				If the paper uses terms like “loss,” “degradation,” or “tragedy,” they are used as <strong>structural consequence descriptors</strong>
				of operator configurations (e.g., <strong>Σ (integration) / Ψ (self-binding)</strong> failure under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>), not as moral judgements,
				intentions, or blame attributions.

			<h3>0.6 ACRED/IA Box (PMS_1.1)</h3>
			<p>This paper uses <strong>ACRED</strong> as shorthand for the five <strong>derived axes</strong>:
				<strong>A (awareness), C (coherence), R (responsibility), E (action/enactment), D (dignity-in-practice)</strong>.
				These axes are <strong>structural projections</strong> of operator compositions; they are not person-diagnostic labels.
			</p>
			<p><strong>IA patterns (Interpretation-/Imbalance-Axis patterns)</strong> are <strong>structural signatures</strong> describing characteristic axis-skews that may occur in scenes, roles, scripts, or regimes.
				IA patterns are <strong>not traits</strong>, not clinical categories, and not global labels about persons.
			</p>
			<h4>IA_A&gt;&gt;E — Excessive gap between Awareness and Enactment</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Code:</strong> <code>IA_A&gt;&gt;E</code></li>
				<li><strong>Name:</strong> Excessive gap between Awareness and Enactment</li>
				<li><strong>Structural basis (schema):</strong> <strong>Ω (asymmetry: evaluative/positional gradient) + Α (attractor: stabilized evaluative script) + Φ (recontextualization: frame shifts reinforcing evaluation over enactment)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Axis effect (plain language):</strong>
					Awareness/option visibility expands while integrated enactment (<strong>E (action) = Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) + Θ (temporality: trajectory/time) + ∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong>) is suppressed or chronically delayed.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Non-diagnostic clause:</strong>
					This pattern is a praxeological configuration (scene/role/script level), not a personality or clinical label.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>IA_Sigma_low — Fragmented integration</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Code:</strong> <code>IA_Sigma_low</code></li>
				<li><strong>Name:</strong> Fragmented integration</li>
				<li><strong>Structural basis (schema):</strong> <strong>high Φ (recontextualization: frequent frame shifts) + low Σ (integration: weak consolidation)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Axis effect (plain language):</strong>
					Frequent frame shifts occur without consolidation; trajectories become unstable, coordination remains fragmented.
				</li>
				<li><strong>Non-diagnostic clause:</strong>
					This pattern describes structural volatility in integration, not inner states, traits, or diagnoses.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Method firewall:</strong> IA identification is descriptive and analytic.
				Any prescriptive use remains subject to the PMS entry condition:
				<strong>Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice)</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>0.7 Paper-internal term definitions (structural, non-normative)</h3>
			<p>The following terms are <strong>paper-internal labels</strong> (not PMS operators). They name recurring <strong>scene-/regime-level configurations</strong> describable in PMS_1.1 operators:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>pseudo-symmetry:</strong> a configuration in which <strong>□</strong> is comparison-dominant and asserts rhetorical parity while <strong>Ω</strong> remains operative in consequences, exposure, and responsibility gradients. Pseudo-symmetry is a <strong>structural substitution</strong> (frame-level), not a moral accusation.</li>
				<li><strong>post-feminist over-steering (PFO):</strong> a regime-level configuration of <strong>□ (frame) control</strong> that attempts to manage or suppress the legibility of <strong>Ω</strong> via narrative/administrative constraints. This is a <strong>structural description of frame governance</strong>, not an ideology critique and not a group label.</li>
				<li><strong>humiliation (structural):</strong> a status-regulation move in which <strong>Ω</strong> is handled via <strong>devaluation scripts</strong> (typically stabilized as <strong>Α</strong>) rather than via <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong>-supported coordination. In this paper, “humiliation” denotes an <strong>operator-readable pattern</strong>, not intention attribution.</li>
				<li><strong>explicitness / option-visibility:</strong> the structural foregrounding of selectable options generated by <strong>Δ within □ across Θ</strong> (i.e., within <strong>A-availability</strong>). Explicitness is <strong>not</strong> equated with <strong>Χ</strong> (distance) and is not treated as epistemic “insight.”</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>0.8 Chapter Closure — Why this frontmatter exists (and what it enables)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (setup):</strong>
				Before any Eden-reading can be PMS-valid, we needed (i) a strict separation of <strong>description vs application</strong> (entry condition), (ii) paper-wide notation discipline (component lists, no “+”), and (iii) a controlled vocabulary in which “sin,” “Eden,” and role-terms can be used without importing theology, psychology, or normativity.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We established PMS–EDEN as an <strong>operator-conform</strong> analysis constrained to <strong>Δ–Ψ</strong>, with explicit guardrails: no person-diagnosis, no moralizing, and no prescriptive use without <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>. We also fixed ACRED axis definitions and the “E vs enactment” discipline as global reference.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 1):</strong>
				With validity and notation stabilized, we can now treat Eden as <strong>text-as-praxis</strong> and ask the first necessary question: <em>which common Eden-readings are category errors under PMS operators?</em> Chapter 1 clears the interpretive ground by identifying the misframings that prevent operator-tracing.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>1. The Initial Problem: Why Eden Is Structurally Misread</h2>
			<p>Eden is typically treated as a story about morality, anthropology, or epistemology. PMS–EDEN treats it as a <strong>minimal praxeological test scene</strong>: a structurally economical configuration in which the emergence of modern asymmetry patterns can be traced with maximal clarity. The recurring misreadings are not merely “wrong interpretations”; they are <strong>category errors</strong>: they replace PMS operators <strong>Δ–Ψ (difference through self-binding)</strong> with moral or psychological primitives, and thereby destroy the possibility of operator-tracing.</p>
			<h3>1.1 Dominant Misframings</h3>
			<h4>1) Eden = immaturity / naivety</h4>
			<p>This reading assumes Eden is a “pre-adult” or “pre-reflective” state. In PMS terms it implies that <strong>A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time; formally A = [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)])</strong> and the prerequisites of maturity are missing. PMS–EDEN rejects this: Eden is <em>praxeologically complete</em>—distinctions <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, a stable contextual structure <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, and temporally sustained differentiation <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> are already available. Eden is not “before maturity”; it is <strong>maturity as A-availability</strong> without deficit pressure.</p>
			<h4>2) Sin = epistemic gain (“one learns through evil”)</h4>
			<p>This reading conflates a breach with learning. It treats the decisive act as producing new <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, new <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>, or new reflexivity <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong>. PMS–EDEN rejects this as a structural confusion: the breach is not an epistemic operator. It does not add structure; it <strong>interrupts</strong> a functional chain. What changes is not “what is known” but <strong>what becomes irreversibly legible</strong> in the consequence field: <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> becomes directionally salient, <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / irreversibility over time)</strong> becomes binding, and <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> becomes structurally active. This is consequence-legibility under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>, not knowledge and not <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> as “insight.”</p>
			<h4>3) Sin = mere norm violation (moral primary concept)</h4>
			<p>This reading inserts a normative axiom external to PMS and makes it primary: “sin = breaking a rule.” PMS–EDEN treats “sin” only as an alias for a <strong>praxeological negative structure</strong>: a conscious breach under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> with available alternatives in <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, realized as enactment under <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> while <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> are absent, failed, externalized, or simulated. No moral law is needed to specify this structure, and none is derived from it.</p>
			<h4>4) Sex difference = essence (instead of role/frame configuration)</h4>
			<p>This misframing reads “man/woman” as metaphysical or psychological essences. PMS–EDEN treats them as <strong>praxis roles</strong>: recurrent configurations of capacity, exposure, and responsibility under <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>. The paper’s claims remain structural and scene-bound: where sexed attributes are relevant, they appear as <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, not as ontological rankings or psychological profiles.</p>
			<h4>5) Loss of reciprocity = bad intent (intentionalism instead of structure)</h4>
			<p>This reading insists that reciprocity collapses because someone “wanted evil,” “wanted domination,” or “intended harm.” PMS–EDEN treats reciprocity loss as a <strong>structural drift</strong>: when <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> becomes salient under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory)</strong> and <strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong>, and when <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> fail to stabilize coordination, <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> forms that maintains the system via avoidance, leveling, or (where relevant) <strong>status regulation via devaluation</strong>. This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution. Intentionalism is an unnecessary psychological add-on that reduces structural clarity.</p>
			<p><strong>Result:</strong> these five misframings are PMS-invalid because they (a) import non-PMS primitives, (b) confuse operators <strong>Δ–Ψ (difference through self-binding)</strong> with moral vocabulary, or (c) move from scenic structure to global person-claims.</p>
			<h3>1.2 PMS Reframing</h3>
			<p>PMS–EDEN replaces the above with a strictly operator-conform account.</p>
			<h4>Eden = a complete praxis frame without deficit pressure (not: without maturity)</h4>
			<p>Eden is defined as a configuration in which:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> is present and relevant (including sexed attributes as differences, not valuations),</li>
				<li>a stable <strong>□ (frame: context / constraint / role space)</strong> structures orientation without scarcity compulsion,</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> sustains differentiation across time, such that <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is structurally available,</li>
				<li><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> may exist without being driven by deficit pressure,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> may be latent without becoming conflict-dominant,</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> is not yet the primary tension engine.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, Eden is not “pre-ethical” or “pre-cognitive”; it is <strong>praxeological completeness without deficit-driven optimization</strong>, with maturity defined strictly as <strong>A (awareness) availability</strong>.</p>
			<h4>The “Fall” = activation of an irreversible consequence-and-legibility field (Λ/Ω/Θ)</h4>
			<p>The “Fall” is the moment in which:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> becomes directionally and socially legible,</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> makes consequences cumulative and non-resettable,</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> becomes active as remainder (“what was possible before is no longer possible in the same way”).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not epistemic enrichment; it is <strong>structural irreversibilization</strong> under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Conflict originates not from knowledge, but from comparison (□) under asymmetry (Ω)</h4>
			<p>The decisive post-breach drift is a reframing of the scene:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>the <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> shifts toward comparison-as-orientation,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> becomes interpreted as relational status difference rather than functional role differentiation,</li>
				<li>stable coordination fails because <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> do not successfully stabilize asymmetry under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory)</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> emerges that reduces short-term tension while accelerating long-term reciprocity loss (Σ/Ψ failure under Ω).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In short: PMS–EDEN does not say “knowledge ruined Eden.” It says: <strong>a conscious breach under A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ]) activates Λ (non-event) / Ω (asymmetry) / Θ (temporality), after which comparison-driven □ (frame) destabilizes coordination and pushes the system toward pseudo-symmetry drift and reciprocity loss unless Σ (integration) / Ψ (self-binding) are established.</strong></p>
			<h2>1.3 Chapter Closure — Misreadings as category errors (and why reframing is necessary)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				To use Eden as a minimal test scene, we needed to remove interpretive moves that replace PMS operators with non-PMS primitives—especially: “Eden = immaturity,” “sin = knowledge gain,” “sin = mere norm violation,” “sex difference = essence,” and “reciprocity loss = intent.”
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We showed that the dominant readings are not merely “wrong” but <strong>structurally incompatible</strong> with operator tracing. We replaced them with a PMS reframing: Eden is a complete praxis configuration with <strong>A-availability</strong>, and the breach is not epistemic but activates a <strong>consequence-legibility field</strong> (Ω/Θ/Λ).
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 2):</strong>
				Once misframings are removed, we need a clean baseline: <em>what exactly is Eden as a PMS configuration?</em> Chapter 2 specifies Eden’s operatorial ground state so that later “changes” can be identified as real structural transitions rather than interpretive overlays.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>2. The Praxeological Ground State (Eden as a PMS Configuration)</h2>
			<p>Eden is introduced here as a <strong>structurally complete</strong> configuration of praxis: not a pre-moral nursery, not a pre-epistemic void, and not an immature stage awaiting “real life.” Eden is a stable scene in which the key structural resources for mature praxis are already present—yet they operate <strong>without deficit pressure</strong>. The novelty of the “Fall” is therefore not that maturity begins, but that maturity (A-availability) becomes exposed to a new class of irreversible consequences under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> and comparison-drifts in <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>2.1 Eden Definition (Operatorial)</h3>
			<p><strong>Eden = stable praxis without deficit pressure, with maturity already available as A-availability.</strong></p>
			<p>Structurally:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> is present: distinctions exist and are salient (including sexed attributes as differences, not valuations).
						<strong>Δ (difference)</strong> is not produced by the “Fall”; it is already part of the ground state.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> is stable: the scene is structured as a coherent context of praxis without scarcity compulsion.
						<strong>□ (frame)</strong> constrains and orients <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> without forcing optimization-by-need.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> is present but not punitive: time exists as trajectory, continuity, and development, but not yet as a binding cascade of accumulated remainder <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>.
						<strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> does not yet function as an irreversible moral ledger; it functions as continuity without punitive accumulation.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>A (awareness: [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)])</strong> is realizable and sustainable: framed distinctions persist across time such that alternatives and consequences are structurally visible.
						In PMS–EDEN, this is the formal sense of “maturity”: not psychology, but <strong>A (awareness) availability within □ (frame) across Θ (temporality)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> exists without dominating as deficit compulsion: directed tension can arise from <strong>Δ (difference)</strong>, but it is not forced into optimization loops by scarcity.
						<strong>∇ (impulse)</strong> is not absent; it is simply not structurally hijacked by lack.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong> is latent but non-escalated: gradients of capacity, exposure, or responsibility may exist, but they are not yet conflict-dominant, weaponized, or comparison-coded inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.
						<strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> exists as a structural possibility, not as a relational crisis.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> is not the central engine: structured absence is not yet the primary tension mechanism of the frame.
						<strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> does not yet function as an unrecoverable remainder that governs the scene.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Therefore:</strong> Eden is <strong>praxis completeness without tragedy pressure</strong>, but <strong>not</strong> without maturity. Here “tragedy” denotes a <strong>structural consequence profile</strong> (e.g., chronic Λ (non-event) + Σ/Ψ failure under Ω), not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution. Maturity is present precisely because <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is structurally possible and stable.</p>
			<h3>2.2 Consequence</h3>
			<p>Eden is not a childish condition. It is a <strong>praxeologically complete setting</strong> in which:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>distinctions <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> are present without valuation,</li>
				<li>a stable context <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> coordinates praxis without scarcity compulsion,</li>
				<li>temporal continuity <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> sustains <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>,</li>
				<li>impulse <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> can exist without becoming deficit-driven,</li>
				<li>asymmetry <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> can remain functional rather than conflict-dominant,</li>
				<li>non-event <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> is not yet the remainder that governs the scene.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is crucial for the central thesis of PMS–EDEN: if Eden already contains maturity as <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>, then the “Fall” cannot be the beginning of maturity, knowledge, or awareness. The “Fall” must be treated as a <strong>reconfiguration of consequence-legibility</strong> under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>, not an epistemic upgrade.</p>
			<h3>2.3 The Apple as Threshold Marker (Maturity Present; NRK Becomes an Explicit Option)</h3>
			<p>The apple is not treated as a symbol of “learning through evil,” nor as a mechanism that generates new knowledge. It marks a <strong>threshold of explicitness</strong> in which a particular option becomes structurally foregrounded:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The paper-internal notion of <strong>possibility space / explicitness</strong> denotes <strong>option visibility</strong> generated by <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>. This option-visibility is <strong>not equivalent</strong> to <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and is not treated as knowledge.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The apple marks that the possibility space has reached a point where a <strong>praxis breach</strong> becomes an explicitly selectable option within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>.
						<strong>NRK is not a PMS operator.</strong> It is a <strong>paper-internal composite / pattern label</strong> that abbreviates a specific operator configuration (a breach under available <strong>A</strong> with <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong> not carrying enactment). It introduces no new axiom beyond the PMS_1.1 set <strong>Δ–Ψ</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>This preserves the core distinction:
						<strong>knowledge ≠ sin, sin ≠ knowledge.</strong>
						The apple does not “teach” or “add insight.” It signals that the scene has matured to the point where an option exists whose selection would constitute a <strong>negative responsibility configuration</strong>: an enactment under <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> despite <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>, with <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> absent, failed, externalized, or simulated.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, the apple functions as a <strong>threshold marker of option explicitness</strong>, not as a generator of epistemic gain. It indicates that Eden already contains maturity as <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>, and that the future possibility of a breach is structurally present as an option—without being necessary, demanded, or morally fated.</p>
			<p>The relevance of this move is methodological: it prevents the common collapse of categories (epistemology ↔ transgression) and keeps the analysis operator-clean. Eden already contains the structural resources for mature praxis; the threshold merely makes the negative option legible as an option—setting up the later claim that the breach “teaches nothing” because the consequence field was structurally anticipable under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> before enactment.</p>
			<h2>2.4 Chapter Closure — Eden as a complete ground state (so the breach cannot be “maturity begins”)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (baseline):</strong>
				If the breach is not to be smuggled in as “epistemic awakening,” we needed a formal account of Eden in which the operators required for maturity (in the paper’s strict sense) are already available—especially <strong>A = [Θ, □, Δ]</strong> under non-deficit conditions.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We defined Eden as <strong>praxis completeness without deficit pressure</strong>: Δ is present, □ is stable, Θ carries continuity, <strong>A-availability</strong> holds, ∇ can operate without scarcity compulsion, Ω may be latent without being conflict-dominant, and Λ is not yet the central tension engine. The apple was positioned as an <strong>explicitness threshold marker</strong> (option-visibility), not as an epistemic generator.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 3):</strong>
				With Eden’s baseline fixed, we can now specify the breach precisely as a <strong>structural interruption</strong> rather than “learning.” Chapter 3 formalizes “sin” as a negative operator constellation: enactment under ∇ in a scene where A is available, but where Σ/Ψ fail to carry enactment—yielding consequences, not knowledge.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>3. Praxis Breach (“Sin”) as Structural Chain Interruption — Not as Knowledge</h2>
			<p>This section formalizes the decisive event as a <strong>praxeological negative configuration</strong> rather than an epistemic event. The breach is not treated as a gain in knowledge, nor as the birth of consciousness, nor as the introduction of <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>. Eden already contains <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / role space)</strong>, and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> in a way that supports <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>. What changes is not what can be known, but what becomes <strong>irreversibly binding as consequences</strong> once enactment occurs without <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and without <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> carrying the act.</p>
			<h3>3.1 Minimal Definition of “Sin” (PMS-Compatible, Alias-Based)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>“Sin” (historical alias) = a conscious praxis breach: the willful realization of a mis-enactment option within a □ (frame: contextual constraint), despite available A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ]) of consequential possibility and despite the structural presence of alternatives.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Key clarifications:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Knowledge ≠ sin, sin ≠ knowledge.</strong>
						The act does not generate <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, does not deepen <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>, and does not add a new operator. The act is a selection among already legible possibilities within <strong>□ (frame)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“Sin” here names a <strong>praxeological negative structure</strong>, not a moral category.
						It can be fully rewritten without the term by specifying its operator profile: enactment under <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> with <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> low/absent and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> absent/failed/externalized/simulated, while <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is available.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Consciousness is not imported as psychology.
						“Conscious” is strictly structural: <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is present in the scene such that alternatives and consequence-possibility are legible within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>3.2 The Operator Interruption (Without Mislabeling as E)</h3>
			<p>In PMS, <strong>E (action: integrated enactment; formally E = [Σ (integration), Θ (temporality), ∇ (impulse)])</strong> denotes <strong>integrated enactment</strong>: impulse <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> carried as trajectory <strong>Θ (temporality: time / trajectory)</strong> through coherent synthesis <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong>. The breach analyzed here fails this criterion. It is therefore not labeled as <strong>E (action: integrated enactment)</strong>, but as <strong>enactment/realization</strong> under a truncated chain.</p>
			<p>A typical interruption profile:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> is activated by <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> and moves within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, but</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> is <strong>low/absent</strong>: there is no coherent synthesis that would align impulse, frame, and consequence-horizon under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is <strong>not established / interrupted / externalized / simulated</strong>: there is no stable commitment that carries an integrated structure across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position)</strong> may be absent, weak, or irrelevant at the moment of enactment (and is not required for description).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, the breach is structurally:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> → <strong>realization</strong> within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>
					while <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> is low/absent and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> is not anchoring the act,
				</li>
				<li>occurring in a scene where <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is available.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the core difference between <strong>integrated action E (action: [Σ, Θ, ∇])</strong> and <strong>mis-enactment</strong>: the latter is not “mere behavior,” but behavior that proceeds <strong>prior to</strong> or <strong>against</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>3.3 “Teaches Nothing” (Conscious → Consequence, Not Insight)</h3>
			<p>The formula “teaches nothing” is not rhetorical. It is a structural claim:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is available prior to enactment, then the selection of the negative option cannot be justified as an epistemic necessity.
					The act does not expand awareness; it merely crosses a threshold where consequences become temporally fixed under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>What the breach produces is not knowledge but a consequence field:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>: consequences become trajectory, not moment—irreversible and cumulative.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong>: gradients of exposure, capacity, and responsibility become legible and directionally charged.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong>: a remainder structure appears—what cannot be “un-happened,” and what reframes the scene by structured absence (loss of a prior closure condition as recoverable state).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>No new <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> is created; differences were already present.</li>
				<li>No new <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is required; the frame already contained the option space.</li>
				<li>No new <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> is introduced; temporality becomes newly binding only insofar as it now carries irreversibility in a consequence field.</li>
				<li>No new <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> is generated; awareness is not “upgraded” by the act.</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> is not redefined as “knowledge”: reflective distance is treated as inhibition and meta-positioning, while option visibility is handled via <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The act yields <strong>evidence of consequence</strong>, not <strong>epistemic surplus</strong>. It converts a legible possibility into an irreversible trajectory.</p>
			<h2>3.5 Chapter Closure — Breach as chain interruption (why the act “teaches nothing”)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (formal event definition):</strong>
				To prevent a collapse back into moral or epistemic storytelling, we needed a minimal event-definition that: (i) stays within PMS operators, (ii) keeps <strong>E (action)</strong> distinct from mere realization/enactment, and (iii) explains why consequences become trajectory-bearing under Θ without positing “new knowledge.”
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We specified the breach as <strong>enactment/realization under ∇ within □</strong> in a scene where <strong>A is available</strong>, while <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> do not carry the act. From this, the key claim follows structurally: the act adds no Δ, no A, no Χ-as-knowledge—it <strong>activates</strong> a consequence field in which <strong>Ω becomes salient</strong>, <strong>Θ becomes binding as irreversibility carrier</strong>, and <strong>Λ becomes remainder</strong>. “Who goes first” was treated as a trajectory-origin claim (Ω/Θ), not as moral ranking.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 4):</strong>
				If the act doesn’t create knowledge, we must still explain the visible post-breach shift often read as “awakening.” Chapter 4 therefore isolates the fig leaves as a <strong>praxis marker</strong> of changed legibility: a new vulnerability framing □, reactive shielding-distance Χ, and the first stabilization scripts Α—without importing psychology.
			</p>
			<h3>3.4 Why “Who Goes First” Matters (Structural, Not Moral)</h3>
			<p>The question of priority is not a moral indictment but a structural asymmetry claim. The first realization of the breach establishes a directional origin for subsequent asymmetry patterns.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>First enactment produces <strong>directed Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong>: an origin gradient of initiative, exposure, and responsibility becomes fixed in the scene.
						Once <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is origin-coded, it cannot be neutralized by symmetric narration alone.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>The origin is not undoable because <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> makes it a trajectory: sequence matters.
						The first act establishes “before/after” as structurally relevant, not merely as chronology.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>After origin is set, stabilization tends to proceed via <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding into a new frame)</strong>: frame shifts, narratives, and post-hoc alignments attempt to re-stabilize the scene.
						<strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> can reinterpret and embed, but it cannot erase the asymmetry origin without a real restoration of <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, “who goes first” matters because:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it sets the initial <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> gradient,</li>
				<li>it locks the scene into <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>-structured aftermath,</li>
				<li>it forces reliance on <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> for post-hoc stabilization.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This explains why, after the breach, the system can no longer return to Edenic completeness by simple awareness or explanation. The problem is not ignorance; the problem is an origin-coded asymmetry <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> in a consequence field where <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> are now irreversibly legible.</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>4. Awareness of the Mis-Enactment (Fig Leaves)</h2>
			<p>This section isolates the post-breach “awareness shift” without importing psychology. The fig leaves are treated as a <strong>praxeological marker</strong>: they indicate a change in the scene’s operator configuration, not the emergence of new bodily information or a new moral faculty. The decisive claim is simple: <strong>no new knowledge is acquired</strong>; what changes is the <strong>legibility and irreversibility of consequences</strong> within the field structured by <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong>, and <strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>4.1 No New Knowledge</h3>
			<p>The post-breach scene is frequently misread as an epistemic awakening (“they discovered nakedness”). In PMS–EDEN, this reading is structurally invalid.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> was already present: bodily differentiation, sexed attributes, and contrasts existed as stable distinctions within the scene.</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / role space)</strong> was already stable: the Edenic frame organized relevance without scarcity pressure; bodily existence was not a surprise-event inside that frame.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> was already available as a condition for <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>; thus, the scene could already sustain framed differentiation across time.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Therefore, “seeing” the body post-breach cannot be the introduction of <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>, <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, or <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>. The narrative does not structurally require epistemic novelty, and PMS–EDEN rejects it as a category error.</p>
			<h3>4.2 What Is New After the Breach</h3>
			<p>What changes is not what can be noticed, but what becomes <strong>structurally binding</strong> once mis-enactment has occurred.</p>
			<h4>4.2.1 Λ becomes active (Λ: non-event / structured absence)</h4>
			<p>Post-breach, <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> enters as a dominant remainder structure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>A prior closure condition becomes a <strong>non-returnable absence</strong>: not a lost feeling, but a structural impossibility of resetting the scene to its pre-breach closure conditions.</li>
				<li>The scene now contains a persistent counterfactual: <em>what cannot happen anymore</em> (<strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>) becomes a continuing constraint.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is not nostalgia. It is the emergence of a stable remainder condition: the prior mode of closure is no longer available.</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h4>4.2.2 Ω becomes instrumentally legible (Ω: asymmetry / directional imbalance)</h4>
			<p>After the breach, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong> becomes readable in a new mode:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Differences <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> that were previously non-evaluative become <strong>potential leverage structures</strong>: exposure, capacity, and vulnerability become salient as directional gradients.</li>
				<li>The scene acquires a new kind of “map”: who can affect whom, who can be harmed by whom, who carries risk for whom—legibility of consequence surfaces under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This does not require a new theory of power or intention. It is a direct consequence of an origin-coded breach within a consequence field: <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes structurally action-relevant.</p>
			<h4>4.2.3 Θ renders consequences irreversible (Θ: temporality / trajectory)</h4>
			<p>The breach locks the scene into <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> as trajectory:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Consequences become cumulative; the act is no longer a moment but a path.</li>
				<li>Reversibility is no longer structurally available as a default state of the scene.</li>
				<li>The post-breach condition is not “punishment” but <strong>non-resettable development</strong> under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, the “new awareness” is not epistemic; it is the awareness of irreversibility inside a consequence field where <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> now governs what can and cannot be undone.</p>
			<h3>4.3 Fig Leaves as Structural Marker (Not Psychological)</h3>
			<p>The fig leaves are treated as a <strong>praxis artifact</strong>: they reveal a reconfiguration of operators <strong>Δ–Ψ (difference through self-binding)</strong>. The question is not “what do they feel?” but “what structure becomes visible in what they do?”</p>
			<h4>4.3.1 Not a shame postulate</h4>
			<p>PMS–EDEN does not posit shame, guilt, or any mental state. The text is read as <em>text-as-praxis</em>: the fig leaves are an enacted response that discloses a new scene grammar.</p>
			<h4>4.3.2 A new □ appears (□: frame → vulnerability framing)</h4>
			<p>The covering behavior indicates a new <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / role space)</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The relevant context shifts from “being-in-practice” to “being-exposed-in-comparison.”</li>
				<li>The body is not newly known; it is newly framed as a site of exposure under potential leverage <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is the first clear signal that the scene is transitioning from a praxis-relation frame to a comparison-vulnerability frame.</p>
			<h4>4.3.3 Rudimentary Χ emerges (Χ: distance / shielding inhibition)</h4>
			<p>The covering behavior also indicates a minimal <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position)</strong> function:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>not reflective maturity (maturity remains defined as <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> availability),</li>
				<li>but <strong>shielding distance</strong>: inhibition of immediate exposure, an attempt to reduce legibility.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> here is not a condition of truth; it is a reactive modulation of exposure. It appears as defensive attenuation—distance used as protection rather than as integration-enabling reflection <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong>.</p>
			<h4>4.3.4 A new Α stabilizes (Α: attractor / script formation)</h4>
			<p>Finally, the fig leaves prefigure a pattern: a proto-script becomes available for repetition.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> begins to form: “hide / cover / reduce legibility” becomes a stabilizable response to the new field.</li>
				<li>The act is not a one-off; it is the emergence of a repeatable stabilization protocol under <strong>Α (attractor)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This matters because it shows how the post-breach world becomes durable: not merely through a single event, but through the formation of scripts <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> that manage the new legibility regime.</p>
			<p><strong>Summary of the section:</strong> the fig leaves do not signify epistemic awakening. They signify that, after mis-enactment, <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> becomes remainder, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong> becomes instrumentally legible, and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> makes the new condition irreversible—prompting a shift in <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / role space)</strong>, the appearance of reactive <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong>, and the stabilization of concealment as <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong>.</p>
			<h2>4.4 Chapter Closure — Fig leaves as legibility management (not shame, not new information)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (post-breach readability without psychology):</strong>
				The narrative shows an immediate behavioral shift after the breach. We needed an operator-readable account that explains this shift without asserting new bodily knowledge, new moral faculty, or inner-state claims—and that fits the already-established consequence field (Ω/Θ/Λ).
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We identified the fig leaves as a <strong>structural marker</strong>: not new Δ, but a new <strong>□ (vulnerability framing)</strong> in which exposure becomes action-relevant under Ω; not “insight,” but reactive <strong>Χ (shielding distance)</strong>; and not a one-off response, but the early formation of <strong>Α (stabilizable concealment script)</strong>. In short, the scene begins to manage legibility rather than integrate coordination.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 5):</strong>
				The breach still needs a compact formal handle that can carry the rest of the paper without collapsing into moral vocabulary (“sin”) or psychological inference (“weakness”). Chapter 5 introduces <strong>NRK</strong> as that upstream handle: a paper-internal pattern name for the breach-type “A available + real options + Σ/Ψ not carrying enactment,” which generates downstream Ω/Θ/Λ legibility.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>5. Negative Responsibility Kernel (NRK) — Formal, Not Deferred</h2>
			<p>NRK is introduced here (not as an appendix) because it is the <strong>minimal formal handle</strong> for the central phenomenon of PMS–EDEN: a consciously chosen praxis breach under available awareness. Without NRK, the analysis risks collapsing into moral vocabulary (“sin”) or into psychological speculation (“weakness”), both of which violate scope. NRK is therefore treated as a <strong>paper-internal composite / pattern label</strong> inside PMS: it names a structurally specifiable enactment type without importing theology, ethics, or diagnosis. <strong>NRK is not a PMS operator (it does not appear in PMS.yaml); it is a shorthand name for a PMS_1.1–describable operator configuration.</strong></p>
			<h3>5.1 Function Within the PMS Ecosystem</h3>
			<p>NRK provides a precise descriptor for a specific <strong>negative praxis form</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>a breach enacted <strong>within</strong> a frame where alternatives are structurally visible (<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>),</li>
				<li>under conditions where consequences are already structurally anticipable across time (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>),</li>
				<li>while the operators that would stabilize responsibility and reciprocity are absent, failed, externalized, or simulated (<strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>NRK is not a “moral concept.” It is a <strong>praxeological kernel</strong>: a minimal pattern that can generate downstream structures.</p>
			<p><strong>Separation from PMS–LOGIC (if used elsewhere in the ecosystem):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>NRK</strong> explains the <strong>enactment type</strong>: <em>what kind of realization occurs</em> under <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, when <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> do not carry the act.</li>
				<li><strong>PMS–LOGIC</strong> (where applicable) explains <strong>post-hoc readability</strong>: how moralized or normative interpretation becomes legible <strong>after</strong> the field has shifted and stabilized, i.e., after <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong>, <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>, and <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> have become structurally active surfaces.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, NRK is upstream: it names the mechanism that produces the consequence field in which later readability becomes possible.</p>
			<h3>5.2 Necessary Conditions (Proposal, PMS-Conformant)</h3>
			<p>NRK requires a configuration in which awareness and alternatives exist <strong>as structure</strong>, not as introspection. The following conditions are <strong>necessary</strong> (not yet sufficient):</p>
			<p><strong>Notation discipline (for this section):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time)</strong> is used as a composite name for the co-availability of <strong>[Θ (temporality: trajectory / time), □ (frame: contextual constraint), Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)]</strong> within a scene.</li>
				<li>Where the shorthand <strong>Θ/□/Δ</strong> appears, it denotes this <strong>co-availability</strong> (not division, not “addition,” and not causality by itself).</li>
			</ul>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Awareness is structurally available:</strong>
						<strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> must be realizable and stable in the scene.
						This means: <strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> is active as relevant distinctions, <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> holds option relevance, and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> sustains these distinctions across time.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Asymmetry is operative (effective as consequence surface):</strong>
						<strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> must be relevant in the sense that capacity/exposure gradients can matter for consequences.
						<strong>Clarifier:</strong> <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> may be <em>latent and non-salient</em> before the breach; NRK requires <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> to be structurally <strong>effective</strong>, even if it is not yet fully legible or comparison-coded as a social status signal.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Temporality is trajectory-bearing:</strong>
						<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> must function as irreversibility carrier: the act enters a path-dependent consequence structure rather than remaining a reversible moment.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>A genuine option-set exists in the frame:</strong>
						<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / role space)</strong> must contain <em>real alternatives</em> (not mere logical impossibility).
						NRK cannot occur where only one action is structurally available.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Integration and/or self-binding do not carry enactment:</strong>
						<strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> is low/failed and/or <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is absent, aborted, externalized (Ψ→Other as demand), or simulated.
						This is the characteristic coupling point: enactment occurs <strong>before</strong> the operators that would generate integrated action <strong>E (action: integrated enactment; formally E = [Σ (integration), Θ (temporality), ∇ (impulse)])</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Note on terminology:</strong>
				NRK does not require that <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position)</strong> is absent; it requires only that <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is not operating as an integrating, reversibility-preserving regulator of enactment. <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> may appear defensively (shielding distance), without producing <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> or <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>5.3 Sufficient Constellation (Proposal)</h3>
			<p>A sufficient constellation specifies not only prerequisites but the decisive form of realization:</p>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>NRK</strong> = <strong>A (awareness: [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)]) high</strong> + <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/responsibility gradients) effective</strong> + <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time) trajectory-bearing</strong> + <strong>real option-set in □ (frame)</strong> + <strong>enactment/realization under ∇ (impulse) within □ (frame)</strong> <strong>despite</strong> anticipable consequences, <strong>with Σ (integration) low/failed and Ψ (self-binding) absent/aborted/externalized/simulated</strong>.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>Key consequences of this definition:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The breach is <strong>not</strong> labeled <strong>E (action: integrated enactment; formally E = [Σ (integration), Θ (temporality), ∇ (impulse)])</strong>, because <strong>E (action)</strong> requires <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> to carry the enactment.
						NRK is precisely the case where enactment occurs <strong>without</strong> integrated action.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>“Consciously chosen” is defined structurally: not as a mental report, but as the presence of <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> plus an option-set within <strong>□ (frame)</strong> plus <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> as consequence-carrier.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>5.4 NRK Typology (Stable, PMS-Internal)</h3>
			<p>NRK is a kernel; kernels can appear in variants depending on how the frame (<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>), attractors (<strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong>), and post-hoc stabilization (<strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong>) participate. The following typology is minimal and structurally legible.</p>
			<h4>NR-1 Impulse-Dominated Breach</h4>
			<p><strong>Profile:</strong> <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> dominates; <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> do not carry enactment.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension):</strong> high directional tension drives realization.</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint):</strong> provides the local opportunity structure.</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis):</strong> low/absent; competing considerations are not synthesized.</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment):</strong> absent/weak; no binding commitment holds against impulse.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time):</strong> still makes the act trajectory-bearing; consequences accrue.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Outcome tendency:</strong> rapid transition into consequence field (where <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong> and <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural gradients)</strong> become increasingly legible); later stabilization often requires <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong> to explain the breach retroactively.</p>
			<h4>NR-2 Justification-Driven Breach</h4>
			<p><strong>Profile:</strong> breach is enabled by a frame manipulation: <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is boosted into a legitimating subframe that allows enactment while simulating integration.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint):</strong> intensified as a <em>justification frame</em> (“this is necessary / fair / deserved”) without claiming morality; it is a structural re-framing.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/responsibility gradients):</strong> often amplified as leverage becomes narratively usable under the justification frame.</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis):</strong> simulated (apparent coherence without actual synthesis into coordinated praxis).</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment):</strong> externalized (Ψ→Other as “the situation made me do it”; “the rule demanded it”; “they forced it”) or replaced by role-claims instead of self-binding.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Outcome tendency:</strong> high post-hoc stability, because the breach comes with a ready-made narrative operator configuration; <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong> becomes a primary stabilizer.</p>
			<h4>NR-3 Stabilized Breach Regime</h4>
			<p><strong>Profile:</strong> the breach pattern becomes durable via <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> formation: NR-2 is no longer episodic but protocolized.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization):</strong> stabilizes a repeatable breach script (hide/justify/level/control) as a default response.</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint):</strong> default-activates the justification subframe when pressure arises.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural gradients):</strong> becomes structurally managed rather than coordinated into reciprocity.</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure):</strong> often increases as non-closure accumulates (promises, reciprocity expectations, repairs) and becomes a persistent remainder.</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) / Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment):</strong> remain low/absent, replaced by patterned management and appearance-maintenance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Outcome tendency:</strong> drift toward pseudo-reciprocity and chronic non-closure; the system becomes resistant to repair because the attractor stabilizes the failure mode itself.</p>
			<p><strong>Operational summary:</strong> NRK names the upstream breach type that converts a mature, option-visible frame (<strong><strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong></strong> high inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>) into a consequence field where <strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / non-closure)</strong>, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong>, and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> become increasingly and irreversibly legible—while <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> fail to carry reciprocity.</p>
			<h2>5.5 Chapter Closure — Why NRK must be introduced early (and what it now licenses methodologically)</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (a portable kernel):</strong>
				To scale from Eden into modern drift patterns, we needed a minimal, stable descriptor for the breach that (i) remains PMS-conform, (ii) avoids theology and diagnosis, and (iii) preserves the E-discipline: enactment/realization is not automatically <strong>E (action)</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We defined <strong>NRK</strong> as a <strong>paper-internal composite / pattern label</strong> (not a PMS operator) that names a specific enactment type: <strong>A-available</strong> within □ across Θ with real alternatives, while <strong>Σ and/or Ψ fail to carry enactment</strong> under ∇—in a context where Ω is effective as consequence surface and Θ is trajectory-bearing. The typology (NR-1/2/3) clarifies how the kernel can appear as impulse-dominant, justification-driven, or attractor-stabilized.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to the next chapter):</strong>
				With NRK formalized, the remaining work is downstream: show how the NRK-generated consequence field (Ω/Θ/Λ) pushes the frame toward comparison, produces pseudo-symmetry pressures, and destabilizes reciprocity unless Σ/Ψ are rebuilt under explicit Ω legibility. The next chapter can now move from <em>kernel → drift grammar</em> without importing non-PMS explanations.
			</p>

			<h2>6. The False Comparison: Sexed Attributes Under Ω (Asymmetry)</h2>
			<h3>6.1 Initial Condition: Differentiation Without Status</h3>
			<p>In Eden, sexed attributes and role-differences are structurally available because <strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> is present. The mere existence of <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> does not imply valuation, ranking, or deficit. Within a stable <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> of non-scarcity, differentiation can remain <strong>functional</strong>: distinctions serve orientation, coordination, and complementarity within praxis, without becoming comparative scorekeeping.</p>
			<p>Crucially, Eden’s maturity condition is not “lack of differentiation,” but the availability of <strong>A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time; composite of Θ (temporality) + □ (frame) + Δ (difference))</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction):</strong> distinctions exist and can be referenced.</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring):</strong> relevance is structured without scarcity-driven competition.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time):</strong> trajectories are legible without consequence cascades.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Thus, sexed attributes can be <em>seen</em> without being <em>converted into status</em>.</p>
			<h3>6.2 Structural Error After the Breach: From Praxis-Relation to Value-Relation</h3>
			<p>After <strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel: a consciously chosen praxis breach under available <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> with Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) and Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) not carrying enactment)</strong>, the scene moves into a consequence field where <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> becomes instrumentally legible and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> makes consequences trajectory-bearing. In that field, a specific frame drift becomes likely: <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> shifts from <em>praxis-relation</em> (coordination and interface logic) to <em>value-relation</em> (ranking and standing logic).</p>
			<p>This is the false comparison: attributes are no longer read as functional distinctions within coordinated praxis, but as <strong>relational indicators</strong> inside a value frame.</p>
			<p><strong>Key structural shifts:</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Attribute recoding (Δ → comparative tokenization):</strong>
						<strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> remains the same operatorially, but its <em>use</em> changes: distinctions become tokens for ranking rather than handles for coordination.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Frame inversion (□: praxis-relation → □: value-relation):</strong>
						The dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> ceases to ask “what supports coordinated praxis?” and begins to ask “who stands higher / who gets more / who owes whom?”
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Asymmetry moralization-as-signal (Ω → grievance coding):</strong>
						<strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> is structurally unavoidable in many role relations (capacity, exposure, obligation gradients). Under the value-relation frame, <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is re-read as a <em>hurt / unfairness signal</em> rather than a structural gradient requiring coordination.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Integration failure (Σ low) and binding failure (Ψ low/absent):</strong>
						When <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> is low and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is absent/aborted/externalized, the system lacks the operators that could synthesize differences into a coherent reciprocity regime. The comparative value-frame (<strong>□ (frame)</strong> as value-relation) therefore becomes the default stabilizer.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Attractor seeding (Α stabilization):</strong>
						Repeated comparative readings form <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> scripts: scanning for advantage, interpreting differences as insults, treating asymmetry as evidence of illegitimacy.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Result:</strong> the same sexed attributes that were already present under <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> become newly <em>interpreted</em> through a drifted <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, under the now-legible <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>6.3 Consequences: Comparison Replaces Coordination</h3>
			<p>Once <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> is dominated by value-relation, structural consequences follow predictably:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Differences → status/affront signals:</strong>
						<strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> is no longer an orienting distinction but a trigger for relational accounting.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Asymmetry → injustice signal:</strong>
						<strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> is no longer treated as a coordinate-able gradient but as a proof-token of illegitimacy.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Function → status comparison:</strong>
						Functional role distinctions are displaced by evaluative ranking.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Coordination collapses into accounting:</strong>
						Instead of stabilizing reciprocity via <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong>, the system substitutes comparative scoring as a pseudo-stabilizer.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Comparison (□ (frame) as value-relation) replaces coordination (Σ (integration) and Ψ (self-binding) as reciprocity carriers).</strong></p>
			<h2>6.4 Chapter Closure — Why false comparison becomes the decisive drift pivot</h2>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After formalizing <strong>NRK</strong> as the upstream breach-type, we still needed to explain <em>how</em> structurally available differences (<strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong>) become transformed into <strong>persistent relational instability</strong>. In particular, we needed to show why post-breach asymmetry <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> does not automatically lead to coordination, but instead tends toward chronic conflict patterns—<em>without</em> invoking intent, ideology, or psychology.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter identified the decisive <strong>frame error</strong>: the shift of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> from <em>praxis-relation</em> to <em>value-relation</em>. Under this drifted frame,
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference)</strong> is recoded from functional distinction into comparative token,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is no longer treated as a gradient requiring coordination, but as a relational verdict signal,</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> fail to carry reciprocity, leaving comparison as the default stabilizer,</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> scripts emerge that normalize monitoring, ranking, and grievance scanning.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Crucially, nothing <em>new</em> is introduced operatorially: the drift is produced by <strong>misuse of □ (frame)</strong> inside the post-NRK consequence field (<strong>Ω / Θ / Λ</strong>). Sexed attributes are not the cause; they are merely <strong>high-salience carriers</strong> of Δ once comparison becomes the governing relevance grammar.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 7):</strong>
				If coordination is replaced by comparison, the system does not merely become unjust or tense—it becomes <strong>structurally expensive</strong>. Chapter 7 therefore analyzes the <em>cost profile</em> of false equivalence: why enforcing equivalence under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> and <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> produces <strong>permanent dissatisfaction</strong>, continuous correction pressure, and escalating narrative repair—even in the absence of material lack or bad intent. The next step is not moral critique, but tracing dissatisfaction as a <strong>compulsion effect of the comparison frame itself</strong>.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>7. Dissatisfaction as a Compulsion Effect of False Equivalence</h2>
			<h3>7.1 Clarification (central)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>What is structurally different (Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)) cannot be treated as equivalent inside a frame (□ (frame: contextual constraint)) without producing permanent observation, correction, and comparison.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>A false equivalence is not merely a semantic mistake. It is a <strong>frame decision</strong>: <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> is set to <em>equivalence-as-value-relation</em> rather than <em>difference-as-praxis-relation</em>. Once this occurs under <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>, the system becomes expensive by design.</p>
			<h4>7.1.1 Mechanism: Why equivalence produces compulsion</h4>
			<p>If <strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> is denied or flattened inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>, praxis loses the ability to coordinate differences directly. The only remaining method to maintain the equivalence claim is <strong>continuous compensatory work</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Permanent comparison:</strong>
						<strong>Δ (difference)</strong> keeps reappearing in outcomes, exposures, capacities, desires, and vulnerabilities.
						The equivalence-claim forces the system to watch for “violations.”
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Permanent correction:</strong>
						Because <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> is structurally legible post-breach, differences show up as gradients in leverage, burden, risk, or reward.
						The equivalence-frame must constantly intervene to re-level what keeps re-emerging.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Permanent justification:</strong>
						To stabilize the equivalence-claim across time (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>), <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding into a new frame)</strong> is repeatedly invoked to narrate each discrepancy as anomaly, injustice, sabotage, or proof of hidden oppression—regardless of whether the discrepancy is structurally generated.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Permanent vigilance across Θ (temporality):</strong>
						Under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>, small gradients accumulate. What could have been locally coordinated becomes historically accounted-for, remembered, and aggregated into a running balance.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This yields a stable compulsion profile:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Dauervergleich</strong> (continuous comparison)</li>
				<li><strong>Dauerjustierung</strong> (continuous adjustment)</li>
				<li><strong>Dauerunzufriedenheit</strong> (continuous dissatisfaction)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Dissatisfaction is not a defect here. It is the system cost of maintaining a false equivalence under ongoing asymmetry.</strong></p>
			<h4>7.1.2 Operator summary (minimal chain)</h4>
			<p>A compact operatorial trace of the compulsion loop:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> persists as structural contrast.</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> enforces equivalence-as-value-relation.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> renders gradients legible (exposure/leverage/obligation).</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> accumulates discrepancies into trajectories.</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong> supplies recurring narrative repairs.</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> stabilizes the loop as a reliable script.</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> remains low (no coherent coordination synthesis).</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> remains weak/absent (no stable self-binding to Σ-supported coordination under real Ω).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The loop does not require bad intent. It requires only the frame choice plus the post-breach consequence field.</p>
			<h3>7.2 Dissatisfaction is not lack</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Dissatisfaction arises from relational Ω-legibility (Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)) inside a comparison-frame (□ (frame) as value-relation), not from objective deficit.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>In PMS terms, dissatisfaction here is a <strong>structural signal of frame mismatch</strong>, not an indicator of material scarcity or intrinsic inadequacy.</p>
			<h4>7.2.1 Why it feels like lack (without being lack)</h4>
			<p>Under <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong>, any visible <strong>Ω-gradient (Ω (asymmetry) as capacity/exposure/responsibility imbalance)</strong> is interpreted as a <em>ranking difference</em>. Because rankings imply deficiency by definition, the system experiences discrepancy as “someone is shorted.”</p>
			<p>But the causal source is not deficit:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>The system is responding to <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> being made <strong>readable</strong> and <strong>action-relevant</strong> post-breach under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
				<li>The system is forced into <strong>comparative accounting</strong> because <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> are not carrying coordination.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>7.2.2 Structural diagnostic (non-clinical, praxeological)</h4>
			<p>A practical PMS check (still non-normative):</p>
			<ul>
				<li>If dissatisfaction decreases when <strong>□ (frame)</strong> shifts from value-relation to praxis-relation, then dissatisfaction was primarily a <strong>frame-cost</strong>, not a deficit signal.</li>
				<li>If dissatisfaction persists independent of frame and is tied to genuine non-availability of options (Δ (difference) not opening options inside □ (frame) across Θ (temporality)), then deficit dynamics may be present (but this is not assumed by PMS–EDEN).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Within PMS–EDEN, the default claim is narrower:</p>
			<p><strong>Dissatisfaction is the expected cost profile of false equivalence under Ω (asymmetry) and Θ (temporality) once Σ (integration) and Ψ (self-binding) are not performing coordination.</strong></p>
			<h3>7.3 Chapter Closure — Dissatisfaction as system cost, not deficit</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After establishing the post-breach drift pivot (comparison-coded <strong>□ (frame)</strong> under effective <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> and trajectory-bearing <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>), we needed a clean explanation for a ubiquitous observable: <strong>persistent dissatisfaction</strong>. Without a formal account, dissatisfaction is easily misread as (a) objective lack, (b) moral failure, or (c) psychological instability—each of which violates PMS–EDEN’s scope. We therefore needed to show dissatisfaction as a <strong>structural output</strong> of a frame choice.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter derived dissatisfaction as a <strong>compulsion profile</strong> produced by <strong>false equivalence</strong>: treating persistent <strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> as equivalence inside a comparison-dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>. Under the post-breach consequence field, the equivalence claim forces continuous compensatory work:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Dauervergleich</strong> (permanent comparison) because Δ reappears in outcomes,</li>
				<li><strong>Dauerjustierung</strong> (permanent correction) because Ω gradients remain action-relevant,</li>
				<li><strong>Dauerrechtfertigung</strong> (permanent justification) via <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> to stabilize the equivalence claim across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>,</li>
				<li>stabilization as <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> scripts when the loop becomes repeatable.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key conclusion is narrow and structural: <strong>dissatisfaction is not a defect here; it is the system cost of maintaining an equivalence frame under real asymmetry when Σ/Ψ do not carry coordination</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 8):</strong>
				Once dissatisfaction is understood as a frame-cost, the next analytic step is to locate <strong>where the earliest stabilizing interventions tend to occur</strong> after NRK: who is structurally nearer to initiating <strong>□ (frame)</strong> moves and <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> repairs, and how the other side’s responses stabilize drift (often via <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> formation and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> re-binding to avoidance). Chapter 8 therefore moves from the compulsion mechanism to <strong>tendency-weighted drift genesis</strong>—still descriptive, still non-moral, and still strictly operator-readable.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>8. Asymmetric Reaction, Drift Source, and His Share (Tendencies, not Absolute Will)</h2>
			<h3>8.1 Weighting (explicit, non-moral)</h3>
			<p>Assuming full adult accountability on both sides (no infantilization, no clinical reading, no ontological ranking):</p>
			<p><strong>Operator-readable tendency weighting (descriptive):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>The initial drift impulse is structurally closer to her.</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is <strong>not</strong> a moral claim and not a claim about essence. It is a <strong>praxeological weighting</strong> that follows from the post-breach configuration.</p>
			<p><strong>Non-normativity guard (G2):</strong> This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h4>8.1.1 Structural reasons (operatorial)</h4>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Lower cost-of-agency under Ω and Θ (initiative proximity)</strong>
						After <strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel: breach under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong> with Σ (integration) and Ψ (self-binding) not carrying enactment)</strong>, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> becomes legible and <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> makes consequences accumulative.
						In many scenes, the party with <strong>lower perceived risk of initiating frame moves</strong> is structurally nearer to the first intervention via <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> and/or <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong>—that is, a change in the dominant frame (<strong>□</strong>) and/or a post-hoc meaning-embedding shift (<strong>Φ</strong>).
						This is not superiority; it is <strong>initiative proximity</strong> under a legible consequence field.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Comparison-coded Ω is experienced as heavier load (Ω → grievance signal inside □)</strong>
						If <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> shifts into a value-relation (comparison frame), then <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> is no longer read as “functional gradient for coordination,” but as “ranking / unfairness signal.”
						Under that reading, the impulse to correct the frame (<strong>□ (frame)</strong>) and repair meaning (<strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>) becomes more urgent.
						The drift begins where <strong>Ω-as-ranking</strong> becomes intolerable enough to demand re-framing.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Primary lever is □ and Φ rather than Σ and Ψ (frame-first stabilization)</strong>
						In a low-<strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> / weak-<strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> environment, stabilization tends to occur by:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>adjusting <strong>□ (frame)</strong> (what counts, what is comparable, what is legitimate),</li>
						<li>and supplying <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> (narrative embedding and post-hoc meaning repair),
							rather than by building <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> as a coordinated reciprocity regime.
							If her reachable lever is primarily <strong>□ (frame)</strong> and <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>, then the earliest “drift step” tends to appear as a <strong>frame move</strong>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Genesis-responsibility ≠ total responsibility.</strong>
				But genesis is <strong>asymmetric</strong> because the first stable perturbation typically occurs at the <strong>□ (frame)</strong> / <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> interface where comparative <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is managed.
			</p>
			<h4>8.1.2 What “asymmetric” means here (strictly)</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Asymmetric genesis</strong> = the first durable deviation is nearer to one side’s typical lever-set in the scene.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>It does <strong>not</strong> mean:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>moral superiority/inferiority,</li>
						<li>exclusive blame,</li>
						<li>inevitability,</li>
						<li>psychological trait inference.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>

			<h3>8.2 His share (not exculpating)</h3>
			<p>His contribution is <strong>real</strong> and structurally describable without importing guilt metaphysics.</p>
			<h4>8.2.1 Baseline stance</h4>
			<ul>
				<li>He attempts to keep <strong>functional asymmetry</strong> intact (<strong>Ω (asymmetry: coordination-relevant gradient of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong>).</li>
				<li>He pushes toward explicitness and stabilization through <strong>clarification</strong> (articulating <strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>), and often toward <strong>trajectory discipline</strong> (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> as consequence-aware continuity).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This can be stabilizing <strong>if</strong> <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> are available. Post-breach, they are often not.</p>
			<h4>8.2.2 Drift amplification via learned stabilization (Α) and re-binding (Ψ)</h4>
			<p>Repeated invalidation inside a comparison-frame yields a predictable stabilization sequence:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation):</strong> “Explicit clarification escalates conflict.”

				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time) re-binding:</strong> commitment shifts from coordination to avoidance.
						Self-binding does not disappear; it <strong>re-binds</strong>:

						<li>to tactical retreat,</li>
						<li>to “not making things worse.”</li>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Result:</strong> functional coordination is abandoned not as innocence but as <strong>stabilized survival strategy</strong> under the active frame <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>His “task failure” is <strong>learned stabilization</strong>, not purity.
				It produces a durable contribution to drift: <strong>coordination capacity is surrendered</strong>, and the comparison-frame becomes uncontested.
			</p>
			<h3>8.3 Tendency clause (against “absolute will”)</h3>
			<p>Genesis here describes <strong>dominant drift logics</strong>, not metaphysical fixations or timeless intentions.</p>
			<h4>8.3.1 NRK is a pattern, not an essence claim</h4>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel)</strong> is a <strong>paper-internal composite / pattern label</strong>, not a PMS operator.
					(NRK does not appear as an operator in PMS.yaml.)
				</li>
				<li><strong>NRK</strong> denotes a <strong>structural enactment-type</strong> under <strong>A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ])</strong>:
					awareness and alternatives are structurally available within a frame, while enactment is
					<strong>not carried</strong> by <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and/or <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.
				</li>
				<li>Typical NRK configuration:
					enactment under <strong>∇ (impulse)</strong> within <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, with <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> effective,
					<strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> trajectory-bearing, and <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong> failing, aborting, externalizing,
					or being simulated.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>NRK introduces <strong>no moral law</strong>, <strong>no psychology</strong>, and <strong>no person-essence claim</strong>.</p>
			<p>It does <strong>not</strong> assert:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fixed character,</li>
				<li>stable inner will,</li>
				<li>total person-definition.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>NRK is strictly a <strong>structural description of operator-carriage failure</strong> and the
				downstream legibility of consequences (<strong>Λ / Ω / Θ</strong>).
			</p>
			<h4>8.3.2 Drift can arise without “wanting the breach”</h4>
			<p>Drift can be generated as <strong>system dynamics</strong> even when neither side “wants sin”:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> = comparison frame becomes dominant,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> may not be named (asymmetry taboo / moral readability pressure inside □),</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> remains low (no synthesis into coordinated praxis),</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> remains weak/misbound (commitment attaches to avoidance or narrative repair via <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / embedding)</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>In that case:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>her drift impulse can be <strong>frame-maintenance pressure</strong> rather than conscious hostility,</li>
				<li>his drift contribution can be <strong>avoidance-binding</strong> rather than conscious abdication.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The model claims <strong>structural tendencies</strong>, not absolute volition.</p>
			<h3>8.4 Chapter Closure — Drift genesis weighting without blame logic</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After formalizing dissatisfaction as a compulsion effect of false equivalence (Ch. 7), we still needed to explain how drift becomes <strong>directional and durable</strong> in a two-role system without collapsing into intent-attribution. The reader needs a structurally grounded answer to a practical question: if the system drifts, <strong>what is the minimal origin move</strong>, and how do both sides contribute to stabilization over time?
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter introduced an explicitly non-moral <strong>tendency weighting</strong>: the initial drift impulse is structurally nearer to her—not as essence, not as superiority/inferiority, but as <strong>initiative proximity</strong> under the post-breach field (<strong>Ω legible</strong>, <strong>Θ trajectory-bearing</strong>, Σ/Ψ fragile). The mechanism was kept operator-clean:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>early drift tends to appear as <strong>□ (frame)</strong> and <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> moves (frame-first stabilization under low Σ/weak Ψ),</li>
				<li>his contribution is not exculpation but a predictable <strong>stabilization sequence</strong>: <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> forms (“naming Δ/Ω escalates”), and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> re-binds away from coordination into avoidance/de-escalation commitments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The result is a readable structural allocation: <strong>genesis-responsibility is asymmetric</strong>, while <strong>drift maintenance becomes bilateral</strong> through learned stabilization and re-binding.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 9):</strong>
				With drift genesis and stabilization tendencies specified, the paper can now name the dominant stabilization regime that emerges when comparison remains governing: <strong>Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)</strong>. Chapter 9 therefore formalizes PS as the durable replacement of Σ/Ψ-based coordination under real Ω: rhetorical parity inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong> substitutes for functional asymmetry coordination, stabilized via <strong>Φ</strong>, <strong>Λ</strong>, and <strong>Α</strong>. This transition is the pivot from “who tends to move first” (Ch. 8) to “what stable protocol the system becomes” (Ch. 9).

			<h2>9. Pseudo-Symmetry as Dominant Drift</h2>
			<h3>9.0 Renaming and Structure Proposal (integrated, not additive)</h3>
			<p>Rename the chapter to make the control logic explicit and review-stable:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Option A:</strong> <em>Pseudo-Symmetry: Denial of Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient) as Drift Engine (with Signals and Counter-Measures)</em></li>
				<li><strong>Option B:</strong> <em>Pseudo-Symmetry Regime: Weighted Attributes under Ω (asymmetry) and the Drift from Σ (integration) to Status Control</em></li>
				<li><strong>Option C:</strong> <em>Pseudo-Symmetry Protocol: Why It Stabilizes Short-Term and Collapses Long-Term (Operator Trace + Guardrails)</em></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This chapter becomes the <strong>pivot</strong> between:
				<strong>comparison-dominant □ (frame: contextual constraint as value-relation)</strong> → <strong>pseudo-symmetry (denial/taboo of Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance))</strong> → <strong>devaluation protocol (Α (attractor: pattern stabilization) / Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure))</strong> → <strong>reciprocity loss (failure of Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) and Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) under real Ω (asymmetry))</strong>.
			</p>
			<h2>9.1 Definition (formal, PMS-internal)</h2>
			<p><strong>Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)</strong> = <strong>rhetorical equality</strong> under <strong>real Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> such that:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is denied or tabooed (Ω may operate in consequences, but Ω may not be named and regulated as a functional gradient),</li>
				<li>responsibility gradients persist (capacity/exposure/obligation distributions remain unequal under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> even while equality is rhetorically asserted),</li>
				<li>option-space is flattened (structural <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is re-described as “the same,” suppressing functional differentiation and role-speech),</li>
				<li>integration is bypassed (<strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> is replaced by narrative equivalence via <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong>),</li>
				<li>self-binding is displaced (<strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> binds to <em>maintaining the equality-appearance</em> rather than binding to coordination interfaces that match real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Notation note (paper-wide):</strong> Wherever “operator signatures” are given, bracket lists <code>[...]</code> denote <strong>component sets</strong> (co-availability / co-configuration), not arithmetic addition. Composition symbols (like <code>∘</code>) are reserved for <em>application statements</em> (e.g., “applied to Ω-handling”) and not used as an alternative spelling for axis formulas.</p>
			<p><strong>Core operator signature (minimal, readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PS = [□ (frame: value-relation / comparison metric), Ω (asymmetry: real gradient), Σ (integration: low/blocked), Ψ (self-binding: misbound to appearance-management)]</strong></li>
				<li>Typical companions (not additional operators): <strong>[Φ (recontextualization: narrative repair surface), Λ (non-event: residue / non-closure), Α (attractor: protocol lock / repeatable script)]</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h2>9.2 Weighted Attributes Under Ω (what is being equalized, and why it fails)</h2>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry functions by <strong>re-weighting attributes</strong> to make them comparable within a value-frame: <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is used as comparison-and-status accounting rather than praxis coordination. The central operation is not the creation of new differences, but the recoding of already available <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> into a single metric that can be “equalized” rhetorically.</p>
			<h3>9.2.1 Attribute classes (PMS–EDEN compatible)</h3>
			<p>Let “attributes” mean <strong>structural capacities and exposures</strong> (operatorially describable surfaces under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>), not essences.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Capacity attributes (Ω-capacity; Ω (asymmetry) as capacity gradients)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>initiative bandwidth (who can act more without immediate penalty)</li>
						<li>scaling power / resource control (who can amplify outcomes)</li>
						<li>physical / institutional leverage (who can impose constraints through the environment)</li>
						<li>resilience under conflict (who can absorb escalation costs)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Exposure attributes (Ω-exposure; Ω (asymmetry) as exposure/vulnerability gradients)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>vulnerability to abandonment, ridicule, exclusion (who is structurally more sanctionable)</li>
						<li>reputational fragility under <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> (what counts as “damage” is frame-dependent)</li>
						<li>dependence risks across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> (who pays longer trajectory-cost for instability)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Coordination attributes (Σ-relevant; Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) capacity)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>ability to integrate differences without ranking (Σ as synthesis into workable interfaces)</li>
						<li>ability to name <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> functionally without weaponizing it (Ω-speech without verdict logic)</li>
						<li>tolerance for explicit role definition in <strong>□ (frame)</strong> without moralization (praxis-frame clarity rather than tribunal framing)</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Binding attributes (dignity-in-practice <strong>D (dignity-in-practice) = [Ψ (self-binding), Χ (distance)] applied to Ω (asymmetry)-handling</strong>, i.e., Ψ and Χ constrain Ω-handling)</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>willingness to hold commitments across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> (durability under time)</li>
						<li>ability to self-limit leverage under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> through <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong>
							(dignity-in-practice <strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry) = Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance) ∘ Ω (asymmetry)</strong>, i.e., Ψ and Χ constrain Ω-handling)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>9.2.2 What pseudo-symmetry does to attributes</h3>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry forces a single value-metric by using <strong>□ (frame)</strong> as comparison surface, then:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>converts <strong>capacity differences</strong> (Ω-capacity gradients) into “status inequality” (capacity becomes moralized standing signal inside □),</li>
				<li>converts <strong>exposure differences</strong> (Ω-exposure gradients) into “victim vs offender” scripts (a role-coding that substitutes for <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>),</li>
				<li>converts <strong>coordination needs</strong> (Σ-work requirements) into “control attempts” (Σ is reframed as domination within □),</li>
				<li>converts <strong>binding asymmetries</strong> (Ψ durability differences) into “unfair burden distribution” (Ψ is read as imposed debt rather than voluntary durable commitment).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Functional coordination via Σ (integration)</strong> is replaced by rhetorical parity inside □ (frame).</p>
			<p>This is a structural substitution: a claim of sameness inside <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong> stands in for actual synthesis via <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and durable commitment via <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</p>
			<h2>9.3 Positive vs. Negative Uses (two faces of the same mechanism)</h2>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry can appear as a <strong>protective buffer</strong> or as a <strong>drift weapon</strong>.
				The difference is not moral; it is structural: <strong>does PS reopen Σ (integration) and Ψ (self-binding) under named Ω (asymmetry), or does PS replace them?</strong>
			</p>
			<h3>9.3.1 Positive use (bounded, transitional)</h3>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry is temporarily admissible as a <strong>de-escalation buffer</strong> if:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it is explicitly framed as <strong>provisional</strong> (Θ (temporality: time/trajectory) bounded),</li>
				<li>it preserves <strong>option visibility</strong> (Δ (difference: minimal distinction) remains speakable and legible),</li>
				<li>it re-opens <strong>Σ-work</strong> (Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) is scheduled and permitted, not bypassed),</li>
				<li>it protects <strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> by preventing immediate weaponization of <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator form (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PS⁺ = [Χ (distance: de-escalation inhibition), □ (frame: temporary parity claim)]</strong> with the <strong>explicit structural target</strong> that <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is reopened and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> is repaired and re-anchored to coordination under named <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> (within reversibility and D).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Here <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> functions as an escalation brake that preserves reversibility; it does not claim that <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> disappears, and it does not forbid Ω being named later for Σ-work.</p>
			<h3>9.3.2 Negative use (regime formation)</h3>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry becomes a <strong>dominant drift</strong> when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it becomes non-reversible (Ω-taboo is stabilized: “Ω (asymmetry) must never be named”),</li>
				<li>it replaces integration (<strong>Σ</strong>) with narrative sameness via <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>,</li>
				<li>it binds <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> to appearance-management inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong> (commitment is to “looking fair,” not to coordinating reality),</li>
				<li>it stabilizes as <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> (a repeatable protocol that self-reproduces).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator form (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PS⁻ = [□ (frame: comparison + Ω-taboo), Φ (recontextualization: justification repair), Λ (non-event: leverage via non-closure), Α (attractor: protocol lock), Σ (integration: low/blocked), Ψ (self-binding: misbound)]</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Short-term conflict reduction, long-term reciprocity decay (Σ/Ψ failure under Ω).</strong></p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h2>9.4 Misreinforcement Signals (warnings: when PS becomes drift)</h2>
			<p>These are <strong>structural warning flags</strong> that pseudo-symmetry is no longer buffering but stabilizing a drift regime.</p>
			<h3>9.4.1 Signal group S1 — Ω denial becomes taboo</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Naming <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient)</strong> is treated as an offense regardless of intent.</li>
				<li>Functional gradients are forced into moralized language by <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong> (“power” becomes “wrong” inside the frame).</li>
				<li>Any role differentiation is equated with domination (praxis-role speech is prohibited by □).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator readout:</strong> <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong> prohibits functional Ω-legibility (Ω cannot be named as gradient).</p>
			<h3>9.4.2 Signal group S2 — Σ substitution (integration replaced by rhetoric)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Conflicts end via “agreement statements,” not via coordinated praxis changes (no <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> enacted).</li>
				<li>“We are equal” is used as closure while obligations remain mismatched under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</li>
				<li>Repeated <strong>Φ (recontextualization: narrative embedding)</strong> substitutes for actual Σ-work (Φ repairs talk; Σ interfaces do not change).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator readout:</strong> <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> high, <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> low (coherence talk increases while coordination outputs remain unchanged).</p>
			<h3>9.4.3 Signal group S3 — Λ leverage (non-closure becomes control)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Unresolved residues are kept alive as implicit debt (<strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> maintained rather than converted into Σ-work).</li>
				<li>“You still haven’t…” becomes the stable control surface (Λ is operationalized as standing claim).</li>
				<li>Repair is postponed while leverage is maintained (Λ persists; <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> accumulates residue into history).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator readout:</strong> <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> shifts from remainder to instrument (Λ becomes a control surface inside □).</p>
			<h3>9.4.4 Signal group S4 — Α protocolization (the regime locks in)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Predictable scripts stabilize (accusation → denial → parity claim → silence → repeat) as <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong>.</li>
				<li>Explicit clarification reliably triggers escalation (naming <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> or <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is punished by <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).</li>
				<li>Avoidance becomes commitment (<strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> binds to conflict-avoidance rather than to coordination and repair).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator readout:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes <strong>PS⁻</strong>; <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> re-binds away from Σ-work.</p>
			<h2>9.5 Counter-Measures (model-conform, non-moral, praxis-first)</h2>
			<p>Goal (descriptive): identify <strong>operator-readable viability constraints</strong> that tend to re-establish <strong>functional coordination</strong> under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> without weaponizing Ω and without forcing equivalence inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Validity reminder (non-prescriptive):</strong> The items below are <strong>structural viability constraints</strong> (descriptive signatures). They are not person-evaluations and not moral injunctions. If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies: <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: [Ψ, Χ] applied to Ω-handling)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>9.5.1 Counter-measure CM1 — Re-open Δ without ranking</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Make differences legible as differences (<strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>).</li>
				<li>Prevent converting <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> into worth-rank inside <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Constraint (descriptive):</strong> <em>Δ (difference) remains visible even when Ω (asymmetry) is sensitive (difference-legibility without rank-conversion inside □).</em></p>
			<h3>9.5.2 Counter-measure CM2 — Frame split: value-frame vs praxis-frame</h3>
			<p>Introduce two explicit uses of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>, distinguished by function (not by new operators):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ᵥ (value/recognition frame; □ as dignity-constraint context):</strong> dignity-in-practice constraints, respect, non-degradation (<strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> as boundary)</li>
				<li><strong>□ᵖ (praxis/coordination frame; □ as interface context):</strong> tasks, roles, exposure gradients (<strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>), responsibility distribution, repair steps (<strong>Σ (integration)</strong> work)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Constraint (descriptive):</strong> <em>Ω (asymmetry) is named and coordinated in □ᵖ (praxis frame); dignity constraints (D) are guarded in □ᵥ (value frame).</em></p>
			<p>This is not the introduction of new operators; it is disciplined frame usage of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>9.5.3 Counter-measure CM3 — Minimal Σ protocol (integration micro-steps)</h3>
			<p>If <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is low, viability tends to increase when integration is rebuilt via <strong>micro-steps</strong> that are legible and reversible, rather than by attempting immediate full synthesis:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>one acknowledged difference (<strong>Δ (difference)</strong> made explicit without ranking)</li>
				<li>one exposure/capacity gradient (<strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>) named without accusation (functional gradient-speech)</li>
				<li>one trajectory commitment (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>) agreed (when and for how long)</li>
				<li>one reversible trial commitment (<strong>Ψ (self-binding: bounded durable commitment)</strong>) time-limited under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and protected by <strong>Χ (distance: inhibition)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator target:</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is incremented via small coordination interfaces that can be revised (preserving reversibility and D).</p>
			<h3>9.5.4 Counter-measure CM4 — Θ-bounding of parity claims (anti-regime clause)</h3>
			<p>Any “we’re equal” statement must be tagged as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>scope-limited</strong> (which domain under <strong>□ (frame)</strong>),</li>
				<li><strong>time-limited</strong> (until when under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>),</li>
				<li><strong>conditioned</strong> (what would revise it, preserving reversibility and <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> capacity).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Constraint (descriptive):</strong> <em>PS is viable only as reversible buffer, not as ontology (scope-limited, time-limited under Θ, and revision-conditioned to preserve Χ).</em></p>
			<h3>9.5.5 Counter-measure CM5 — Dignity-in-practice constraint (D = Ψ ∘ Χ ∘ Ω)</h3>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry often masks dignity violations via narrative equality.
				The counter is not moralizing; it is structural restraint:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition):</strong> pause escalation loops and prevent immediate leverage use</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure gradients):</strong> name where harm can be done (functional legibility in □ᵖ)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment):</strong> commit to non-degradation constraints across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Constraint (descriptive):</strong> <em>No coordination move counts as viable if it requires degrading the other’s standing-in-practice (D violation) to stabilize the frame.</em></p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural constraint</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h2>9.6 Self-Control &gt; Other-Control (the central pivot)</h2>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry tends to persist when control is attempted <strong>via the other</strong> (frame coercion, narrative domination, obligation externalization).
				Structural recovery tends to require <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> anchored to self-control rather than Ψ→Other binding demands.
			</p>
			<h3>9.6.1 Why other-control is structurally unstable</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>It recruits <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / residue)</strong> as leverage (unclosed remainder becomes debt).</li>
				<li>It recruits <strong>Φ (recontextualization: narrative embedding)</strong> as dominance tool (repair talk replaces coordination).</li>
				<li>It hardens <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> into protocol (repeatable coercion scripts).</li>
				<li>It prevents <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong>, because integration requires reversibility and mutual stance (and therefore at least minimal <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> anchored to self-restraint).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator consequence:</strong> drift becomes self-feeding (□/Φ/Λ/Α substitute Σ/Ψ under Ω).</p>
			<h3>9.6.2 Definition: Self-control (PMS-conform)</h3>
			<p><strong>Self-control</strong> = binding one’s own leverage use under <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural gradients)</strong> with reflective distance (<strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong>), producing stable commitments (<strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong>) that protect coordination and dignity.</p>
			<p><strong>Form:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Self-control = (Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance)) applied to Ω (asymmetry)-handling inside □ᵖ (praxis frame), constrained by D (dignity-in-practice)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>9.6.3 Minimal self-control commitments (practical)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>“I will not use unresolved residues (<strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong>) as leverage.”</li>
				<li>“I will not forbid naming <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> as a functional gradient; I will forbid weaponizing Ω as verdict.”</li>
				<li>“I will accept bounded trials (time-limited under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>) instead of demanding immediate narrative closure (<strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>) as substitute for integration (<strong>Σ (integration)</strong>).”</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are <strong>structural moves</strong>, not virtues.</p>
			<h2>9.7 Summary</h2>
			<p>Pseudo-symmetry is not “lying,” but a <strong>structural replacement</strong>: it substitutes rhetorical parity inside <strong>□ (frame: value-relation)</strong> for functional coordination under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong>. As a temporary buffer, PS can lower immediate conflict costs if it preserves Δ (difference) visibility and reopens Σ-work under reversibility. As a regime, PS denies Ω-legibility, replaces <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> with <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong>, operationalizes <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> as residue leverage, and stabilizes as <strong>Α (attractor)</strong>—thereby binding <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> to appearance-management rather than to coordinated praxis. The model-conform exit is not moral accusation but a controlled reopening of <strong>Δ (difference)</strong>, a disciplined split of frames (<strong>□ᵥ/□ᵖ</strong>), micro-Σ integration steps under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>, dignity constraints (<strong>D (dignity-in-practice) = Ψ ∘ Χ ∘ Ω</strong>), and a strict pivot from other-control to self-binding self-control.</p>
			<h3>9.8 Chapter Closure — PS as a stable substitution regime (not a moral claim)</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After Chapters 6–8, we had the upstream ingredients (comparison drift in <strong>□</strong>, compulsion costs, tendency-weighted genesis). What was still missing was the <strong>named mechanism</strong> that makes drift <em>durable</em>: a repeatable way the system can “stabilize” while avoiding the operators that would actually coordinate reality (<strong>Σ/Ψ under real Ω</strong>). Without this, the reader is left with scattered effects but no single structural handle.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter formalized <strong>Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)</strong> as that handle: <strong>rhetorical parity inside a comparison-dominant □</strong> while <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> remains real in consequences. PS was shown as a <strong>substitution pattern</strong>:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω</strong> becomes taboo/denied as a functional gradient (unspeakable as coordination object),</li>
				<li><strong>Σ</strong> is replaced by <strong>Φ</strong> (narrative repair substitutes interface change),</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ</strong> binds to appearance-management rather than to explicit coordination commitments,</li>
				<li><strong>Λ</strong> remains open as residue/leverage,</li>
				<li><strong>Α</strong> protocolizes the loop into a reliable script.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Crucially, PS was also disciplined into <strong>two structural uses</strong>: a bounded transitional buffer (<strong>PS⁺</strong>) versus a regime-forming drift protocol (<strong>PS⁻</strong>). The chapter ended with a viability path that does not moralize: reopen <strong>Δ</strong> without ranking, split <strong>□ᵥ/□ᵖ</strong>, rebuild Σ in micro-steps, bound parity claims under <strong>Θ</strong>, and pivot from other-control to <strong>Ψ→Self</strong>-anchored self-control under <strong>D</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 10):</strong>
				PS explains a <em>local</em> stabilization logic. The next step is to explain why PS can become <strong>repeatable across scenes</strong> and feel like an ambient cultural grammar rather than a local conflict. Chapter 10 therefore lifts the analysis from scene-level drift to a <strong>meta-frame regime hypothesis</strong>: a stable <strong>□ configuration</strong> that systematically enforces <strong>Ω-illegibility</strong>, elevates <strong>Φ</strong> as constant repair surface, keeps <strong>Λ</strong> open, suppresses consolidation of <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong>, and stabilizes the PS⁻ protocol as <strong>Α</strong>.

			<h2>10. Postfeminist Override as an Asymmetry Regime (structural, not ideological)</h2>
			<h3>10.0 Positioning in the Master Trace</h3>
			<p>This chapter specifies a <strong>regime-level frame</strong> that can sit <em>above</em> the local Eden-drift sequence:</p>
			<p><strong>Eden → Threshold (Apple) → NRK (paper-internal composite / pattern label) → comparison-dominant □ (frame) → pseudo-symmetry → devaluation → reciprocity loss</strong></p>
			<p>Here, <em>postfeminist override</em> is treated as a <strong>stabilizing meta-frame</strong> that makes the drift <strong>repeatable</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>it hardens <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> as a comparison metric plus taboo on <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/responsibility)</strong> legibility,</li>
				<li>it elevates <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> as constant repair surface,</li>
				<li>it keeps <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> open as persistent remainder,</li>
				<li>it blocks <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> so coordination cannot consolidate,</li>
				<li>it stabilizes as <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as a protocol: denial + indirect control + devaluation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>No ideology critique is required for this description. The regime is defined <strong>only by operator behavior</strong>.
				The analysis applies independently of political self-identification.
			</p>
			<h2>10.1 Structural Diagnosis (not ideological)</h2>
			<p><strong>Postfeminist Override (PFO)</strong> is a <strong>frame configuration</strong> with the following structural aims:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Disallow functional asymmetry (Ω) as speakable object</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> may exist materially, but it is treated as illegible or forbidden in discourse within the dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>.</li>
						<li>The dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong> collapses “naming <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>” into “justifying <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>,” thereby blocking functional coordination talk.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Avoid establishing real symmetry</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Real symmetry (here: reciprocity) would require <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> plus <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> to coordinate roles, risks, and responsibilities under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>.</li>
						<li>PFO blocks the conditions for that coordination because such coordination would require <strong>explicit distribution</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> (role-speech, explicit gradients, explicit interfaces).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Block coordination out of rollback fear</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Any attempt to regulate <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> is read (within the regime-frame <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>) as potential regression.</li>
						<li>Therefore, explicit role clarification inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong> is penalized, even when it would be required for <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> to stabilize reciprocity.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Operator form (regime definition):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>PFO = □ (frame: contextual constraint) configured as (Ω-taboo + comparison metric) + Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding) high + (Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) suppressed) + (Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) displaced/misbound)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Key outcome:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Over-ordering with simultaneous denial of asymmetry</strong>: regulation occurs, but it must remain <strong>unacknowledged</strong> as regulation (because <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is unspeakable inside the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10.2 Mechanism: How the Regime Generates “Over-ordering with Denial”</h2>
			<p>PFO produces a characteristic control structure:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> cannot be named → therefore it cannot be coordinated openly in a praxis-use of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Coordination pressure still exists (praxis does not disappear under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Thus the system shifts to <strong>indirect control surfaces</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is used to redefine what counts as legitimate action (permission via framing rather than via explicit coordination),</li>
						<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> is used to rewrite meaning post-hoc (repair-by-interpretation instead of repair-by-integration),</li>
						<li><strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> is used to keep residues open as standing claims (unclosed remainder becomes leverage surface),</li>
						<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> stabilizes the protocol as a repeatable script (the same indirect moves recur).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This yields a stable pattern:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>control without acknowledgment</strong></li>
				<li><strong>regulation without explicit responsibility</strong> (because <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> is not anchored to explicit role-responsibility under <strong>□ (frame)</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator chain (typical):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: Ω-taboo + comparison) → Φ (recontextualization: rewrite) → Λ (non-event: open remainder) → Α (attractor: protocolization)</strong>
					with <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> low and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> misbound/displaced as the coupling point (coordination cannot consolidate as reciprocity).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h2>10.3 Why Devaluation Remains as Structural Residue</h2>
			<p>In PMS–EDEN, <strong>humiliation</strong> is a paper-internal structural term: <strong>status regulation via devaluation</strong> as a residual stabilization mode when <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> cannot be coordinated through <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong>.</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>10.3.1 The structural necessity claim (not moral, not psychological)</h3>
			<p>If the regime imposes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> must not be named (Ω-illegibility inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>),</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> must not consolidate (integration is treated as suspect if it involves explicit asymmetry-handling),</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> cannot bind to explicit role-responsibility (binding would require admitting what is being bound),</li>
			</ul>
			<p>then the system has only a small set of stabilization options:</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Suppression / displacement</strong> (attempt to delete conflict objects)</p>
					<ul>
						<li>unstable because praxis keeps producing <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> signals in outcomes (capacity/exposure gradients remain consequential under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Permanent monitoring and micro-correction</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>costly because comparison-frame use of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> requires continuous alignment work over <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> (permanent re-leveling against recurrent gradients).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Residual stabilization via devaluation</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>the cheapest way to reduce the salience of <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is to reduce the standing of the carrier of Ω-signals (or the one who makes <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> legible).</li>
						<li>devaluation functions as a <strong>shortcut</strong>: it substitutes status operations for coordination work (substituting <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization) status scripting</strong> for <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong>).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>humiliation is not posited as intent, vice, or desire.</li>
				<li>it is modeled as <strong>the residual control mode</strong> that remains when the system forbids explicit coordination via <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and explicit binding via <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator form:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Humiliation (status regulation via devaluation) = Α (attractor: status-regulation script) driven by □ (frame: comparison/value-relation) under Ω-taboo, maintained by Λ (non-event: residue/non-closure), with Σ (integration) and Ψ (self-binding) blocked/displaced</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h2>10.4 Why the Man is the Typical Target (structural, not blame)</h2>
			<p>This is not “fault assignment.” It is a <strong>visibility claim</strong> about where <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> becomes most legible under the regime.</p>
			<h3>10.4.1 Three structural reasons</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>He is a salient carrier of Ω</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Under sexed attribute differences (<strong>Δ (difference: minimal structural distinction)</strong> already present), the male position tends to be read as higher leverage / capacity gradient in many contexts.</li>
						<li>Even if the gradient is local or partial, its <em>visibility</em> is high within the dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>His agency is not discursively neutralizable</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>Attempts to describe his action as “functional coordination” are pulled back into the comparison-use of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> (praxis-talk is re-coded as value-talk).</li>
						<li>Thus his <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/leverage gradient)</strong> becomes easy to encode as “unfairness signal” inside the comparison/value use of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>He does not control the dominant frame</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li>PFO is a frame regime: whoever operates the prevailing interpretive grammar can steer <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> and operationalize <strong>Λ (non-event: residue / non-closure)</strong>.</li>
						<li>If he is outside that grammar, his attempts at explicitness (naming <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> or <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>) are penalized as “power talk” by the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<h3>10.4.2 Resulting pattern</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>The system reduces coordination pressure by <strong>making the salient Ω-carrier the problem object</strong> (status operations substitute coordination).</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>This is compatible with the earlier pseudo-symmetry logic:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> denial + responsibility persistence requires a scapegoat surface.</li>
						<li>the salient surface is often male-coded.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h2>10.5 The Tragic Transition</h2>
			<p>Once <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> cannot be named and reciprocity (Σ/Ψ under Ω) cannot be established, the system enters a <strong>tragic mode</strong>.</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>10.5.1 Λ becomes permanently open</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure / structured absence)</strong> is no longer a temporary remainder after rupture.</li>
				<li>it becomes an instrument and a standing background: “never enough,” “still not resolved.”</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Form:</strong> <strong>Λ-high (non-event: chronic remainder-field)</strong>.</p>
			<h3>10.5.2 Θ becomes a cumulative erosion trajectory</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> no longer supports repair accumulation via <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong>.</li>
				<li>it supports <strong>debt accumulation and erosion</strong>: the longer the regime holds, the more irreversible the drift becomes.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Form:</strong> <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> shifts from development to <strong>cumulative erosion across time</strong>.</p>
			<h3>10.5.3 Α stabilizes devaluation as routine</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>repeated cycles of indirect control (<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> / <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> / <strong>Λ (non-event: residue)</strong>) and status correction stabilize into scripts.</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> makes the regime self-feeding: each episode trains the next.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Form:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> = protocolization of devaluation.</p>
			<h3>10.5.4 Tragedy clause</h3>
			<p>This is not moral desert. It is structural probability:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>both sides incur losses:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>she loses genuine reciprocity because <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> / <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> cannot consolidate under Ω-taboo,</li>
						<li>he loses standing and coordination channels because <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is weaponized against him inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>,</li>
						<li>the relation loses reversibility because <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> locks in residues through <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Tragedy</strong> here means: under this regime, mutual losses become likely even without malice, because the system forbids the operators (<strong>Ω-legibility</strong>, <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>, <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>) required for stable coordination and dignity-in-practice (<strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restraint in handling asymmetry) = Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) ∘ Ω (asymmetry)</strong>).</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h2>10.6 Boundary Markers</h2>
			<p>This regime description applies <strong>only if</strong> the following operator constraints hold:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong> is materially present but discursively illegible in the dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</li>
				<li>coordination attempts that require explicit role-responsibility (a praxis-use of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>) are penalized.</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> and <strong>Λ (non-event: residue / non-closure)</strong> function as control surfaces (not merely adaptation and remainder).</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> remain chronically low or misbound/displaced.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If these constraints are absent, “PFO” (as defined here) does not apply, or applies only partially.</p>
			<h2>10.7 Compact Formalization</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>PFO (regime):</strong>
						<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> enforces Ω-taboo + comparison metric, <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> repairs narratives continuously, <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> remains open, <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> is suppressed, <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> binds to appearance-management rather than explicit coordination.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Residual stabilization outcome:</strong>
						<strong>Humiliation (status regulation via devaluation)</strong> emerges because it is the remaining low-cost stabilization mode when explicit <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> / <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> / <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> coordination is blocked.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Tragic drift:</strong>
					<strong>Λ-high (chronic non-closure) + Θ-loss (cumulative erosion over time) + Α-routine (attractor protocolization)</strong> → reciprocity decay without requiring moral intent.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>10.8 Chapter Closure — PFO as meta-frame: repeatability without ideology</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After defining PS as the dominant drift mechanism, we needed an explanation for <strong>why the same drift pattern can recur across contexts</strong> even when local intentions differ: why Ω-speech is systematically penalized, why coordination is repeatedly displaced into narrative repair, and why residues remain structurally active. Without such a layer, PS risks being read as “just this couple” or “just this scene.”
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter proposed <strong>Postfeminist Override (PFO)</strong> as a <em>purely structural</em> <strong>meta-frame configuration</strong>: a dominant use of <strong>□</strong> that simultaneously (a) enforces a comparison metric and (b) treats functional <strong>Ω-legibility</strong> as taboo—thereby blocking the very coordination work that would be required for reciprocity (<strong>Σ/Ψ consolidation</strong>). The chapter clarified the regime’s control surfaces:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Φ</strong> rises to a constant repair function (meaning-management substitutes interface change),</li>
				<li><strong>Λ</strong> stays open as standing remainder (non-closure becomes stabilizing background),</li>
				<li><strong>Α</strong> locks the protocol into repeatable scripts,</li>
				<li>residual stabilization tends to drift toward <strong>devaluation</strong> as the low-cost substitute when explicit coordination is structurally disallowed.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>The key discipline point is retained: PFO is <strong>not</strong> an ideology claim, not a group label, and not motive inference—only an operator-defined regime hypothesis.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 11):</strong>
				If PFO is a regime that suppresses Ω-legibility and blocks Σ/Ψ consolidation, the decisive downstream question is: <strong>what exactly is lost</strong> when reciprocity cannot form, and how does that loss distribute structurally across roles over time (<strong>Θ</strong>) with chronic residues (<strong>Λ</strong>)? Chapter 11 therefore cashes out the consequence field: <strong>loss of reciprocity</strong> as an operator-readable erosion pattern—“tragedy” as structural probability, not “guilt” as moral verdict.
			</p>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>11. Loss of Reciprocity (Tragedy, not Guilt)</h2>
			<h3>11.1 Reciprocity (PMS)</h3>
			<p><strong>Reciprocity</strong> is not symmetry. It is <strong>coordinated asymmetry</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Definition (operator form):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Reciprocity = Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis) under Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients), bound by Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time), limited by Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / escalation brake)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> is real and treated as a functional condition (not denied, not moralized).</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> produces coherent coordination across role, exposure, and obligation gradients.</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> stabilizes commitments so reciprocity persists across time (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>) and across recontextualization (<strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong>).</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> limits escalation and prevents integration from becoming coercion (binding remains reversible and dignity-preserving under <strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong>).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Minimal reciprocity condition:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry) legible + Σ (integration) active + Ψ (self-binding) anchored + Χ (distance) present</strong></li>
				<li>If any of these collapses, reciprocity becomes unstable or simulated.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>11.2 Structural Collapse Sequence</h3>
			<p>Loss of reciprocity in PMS–EDEN is not a sudden moral failure. It is a <strong>predictable drift</strong> once the system enters:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>comparison-frame dominance (□ as value-relation; □ (frame: contextual constraint))</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω denial or taboo (Ω-illegibility; Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance))</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>chronic Λ (open remainder / “never enough”; Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure))</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Σ low/failed (Σ (integration: coherence synthesis))</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ absent / externalized / simulated (Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) displaced; including Ψ→Other externalization as demand)</strong>,</li>
				<li><strong>Α protocolization (Α (attractor: pattern stabilization))</strong> of indirect control and devaluation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator chain (collapse):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ᵥ (comparison/value frame: a use of □ (frame) oriented to ranking) → Ω taboo (Ω (asymmetry) illegible) → Σ blocked (Σ (integration) cannot consolidate) → Ψ displaced (Ψ (self-binding) misbound/externalized) → Λ chronic (Λ (non-event) remains open) → Α stabilizes devaluation (Α (attractor) locks the script)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h3>11.3 Consequences (differentiated erosions)</h3>
			<p>These are <strong>structural erosions / reductions of available channels</strong>, not verdicts about persons.
				This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.
			</p>
			<h4>11.3.1 He loses enacted dignity and action-space</h4>
			<p><strong>Erosion profile (HIM):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> degrades because D requires <strong>Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance) ∘ Ω (asymmetry)</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes weaponized or unspeakable,</li>
						<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is penalized as “withdrawal” or “domination management,”</li>
						<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> is forced into defensive bindings (avoidance protocols rather than coordination commitments).</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>E (action: integrated enactment)</strong> narrows because <strong>E (action) = [Σ (integration), Θ (temporality), ∇ (impulse)]</strong> (integrated enactment over time):</p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is prevented from stabilizing coordination,</li>
						<li>enactment becomes reactive, minimized, or reframed as illegitimate inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Typical structural form:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to conflict-avoidance, <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes minimization, <strong>□ (frame)</strong> interprets his agency as unfairness signal, producing shrinking action-space.</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>11.3.2 She loses orientation and security</h4>
			<p><strong>Erosion profile (HER):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Orientation degrades</strong> because stable orientation requires coherent framing and trajectory under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>chronic <strong>Λ (non-event: open remainder)</strong> plus continuous <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> repairs pressure coherence,</li>
						<li>comparison-use of <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> requires constant recalibration; nothing becomes “settled” via <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Security degrades</strong> because security in asymmetry requires legible <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> plus stable <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>if <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> cannot be named, it cannot be reliably coordinated,</li>
						<li>if <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> cannot bind to explicit role-responsibility, commitments remain unstable or implicit across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Typical structural form:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>permanent monitoring costs replace stable coordination, producing chronic dissatisfaction and uncertainty (system costs, not deficit assumptions).</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>11.3.3 The system retains stability only via devaluation</h4>
			<p>When:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> cannot be coordinated (Ω-illegible under <strong>□ (frame)</strong>),</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> cannot integrate (coordination synthesis blocked),</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> cannot bind explicitly (commitment displaced/externalized),</li>
			</ul>
			<p>the system’s remaining stabilization mode is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>status regulation via devaluation</strong> (PMS-internal “humiliation” as residual stabilization).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>stability becomes parasitic</strong>:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>it is maintained by lowering standing rather than coordinating roles via <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Both erode—differently, but materially and structurally (channel-reduction under Θ with Λ remainder).</strong></p>
			<h3>11.4 Tragedy Clause (explicit)</h3>
			<p>This chapter asserts a tragedy claim, not a blame claim:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>tragedy = <strong>high likelihood of mutual erosions under a regime that blocks Ω-legibility and forbids Σ (integration)/Ψ (self-binding) consolidation</strong>.</li>
				<li>guilt would require a moral evaluation of persons; PMS does not do that.</li>
				<li>PMS describes how a structure can become self-reinforcing even when no party aims at harm.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>11.5 Chapter Closure — Reciprocity loss as channel erosion under Θ (not blame)</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After PS (scene mechanism) and PFO (regime layer), we needed a clear, reader-legible answer to “so what?” that remains PMS-conform: <strong>what collapses when reciprocity fails</strong>, and why does that collapse persist even when no one “wants harm”? Without a closure, readers tend to translate the account back into psychology (“he withdraws,” “she controls”) or morality (“who is wrong?”), which the paper explicitly forbids.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter defined <strong>reciprocity</strong> as coordinated asymmetry: <strong>Σ under real Ω, bound by Ψ, limited by Χ</strong>. It then specified a collapse sequence where comparison-dominant <strong>□</strong> plus Ω-taboo blocks Σ-work, displaces Ψ into externalization or appearance-management, keeps <strong>Λ</strong> chronically open, and stabilizes the whole via <strong>Α</strong>. The consequences were framed as <strong>channel erosion</strong> rather than verdicts:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>fewer workable coordination interfaces (Σ-output reduction),</li>
				<li>weaker durable commitments that survive across time (Ψ validity collapse),</li>
				<li>increased residue accumulation (Λ chronic) under irreversible trajectory (Θ),</li>
				<li>stabilization via status operations when coordination is structurally blocked (devaluation as residual mode).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>“Tragedy” was disciplined as a <strong>structural probability of mutual losses</strong> under a configuration that forbids the operators required for repair—not as desert, not as diagnosis, not as moral ranking.</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 12):</strong>
				Once reciprocity loss is formalized as erosion, the next task is methodological and practical: specify <strong>how to detect, separate, and evaluate</strong> these drift configurations without importing moral law or psychology—i.e., to provide operator-readable signatures, guardrails, and disciplined application constraints. Chapter 12 therefore shifts from consequence description to <strong>diagnostic legibility and method discipline</strong> (what can be claimed, what cannot, and what counts as operator-evidence under PMS entry conditions).

			<h2>12. Truth vs PMS Application (strict separation)</h2>
			<h3>12.1 Central Clarification</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position) is not a condition for truth. Χ (distance) is a condition for binding.</strong></p>

			<p>Truth-claims (descriptions, analyses, formalizations) can be made without enacting <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> as a practical stance.
				But <strong>PMS becomes normatively relevant</strong> only when the analysis is <strong>used as a guide for action or binding</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>12.2 Two domains: Descriptive discourse vs PMS-valid application</h3>
			<p><strong>Notation discipline (paper-wide):</strong> Bracket lists like <code>[...]</code> denote <strong>component co-availability / co-configuration</strong> (not arithmetic addition). The <code>+</code> symbol is avoided in axis/signature formulas to prevent “sum” readings. Where an operator is described as <em>constraining the handling of Ω</em>, this is expressed in plain language (“applied to Ω-handling”) rather than by reusing <code>∘</code> as an alternative axis notation.</p>
			<h4>12.2.1 Descriptive domain (allowed without Χ)</h4>
			<p>In the paper:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>descriptions may be sharp,</li>
				<li>operator attributions may be explicit,</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> may be named,</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> trajectories may be stated.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This domain is <strong>not yet PMS application</strong>. It is model description and critique.</p>
			<p><strong>Form:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Descriptive analysis = operator mapping without enforced self-binding (Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) imposed as obligation)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<h4>12.2.2 Application domain (PMS validity gate)</h4>
			<p>PMS is <em>applied</em> when an analysis is used to:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>demand actions,</li>
				<li>prescribe bindings,</li>
				<li>externalize normativity (“you must…”),</li>
				<li>enforce coordination,</li>
				<li>justify asymmetry management as obligation.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>At that moment, the <strong>entry condition</strong> activates:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>acceptance of <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong>,</li>
				<li>reversibility,</li>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> constraints.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Validity gate (entry condition; descriptive):</strong>
				At the point where PMS is used to <strong>bind, obligate, prescribe, or enforce</strong>, PMS treats application as <strong>valid only under</strong> the accepted guardrails: <strong>Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling)</strong>. If these guardrails are suspended, the move remains describable (as discourse) but is <strong>formally invalid as PMS application</strong> even if PMS vocabulary is used.
			</p>
			<h3>12.3 Practical test: when a paragraph crosses into application</h3>
			<p>A passage functions as PMS application (rather than description) if it <strong>does</strong> any of the following:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>implies <strong>Ψ→Other</strong> (externalized binding): demanding that the other bind (“you must…”),</li>
				<li>performs <strong>normative externalization</strong>: turning analysis into obligation (“this must be enacted”),</li>
				<li>removes <strong>revision capacity</strong>: treating binding as irreversible while bypassing <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and reversibility (“no distance / no exit / no revision allowed”).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>If such markers are present, the paragraph has crossed from <strong>descriptive operator mapping</strong> into an <strong>application move</strong>. In PMS terms, application viability becomes assessable only under the entry condition constraints: <strong>Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling)</strong>. Without these constraints, the move may still be analyzed, but it is <strong>not PMS-valid as application</strong>.</p>
			<h3>12.4 Why the separation matters for this paper</h3>
			<p>This paper contains two layers that must not be confused:</p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Structural explanation of drift</strong> (Eden sequence; NRK; comparison-frame; pseudo-symmetry; devaluation; reciprocity loss).</li>
				<li><strong>Conditions for using the explanation as guidance</strong> (<strong>Χ (distance)</strong> + <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> + reversibility).</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Keeping them separate prevents a common failure mode:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>turning a structural diagnosis into a coercive instrument.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Therefore:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>the paper may describe “regimes” without enacting them,</li>
				<li>but any attempt to operationalize conclusions must satisfy PMS application conditions.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>12.5 Chapter Closure — The binding gate (Χ) protects PMS from coercive misuse</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After Chapters 1–11, the analysis is structurally sharp (NRK → drift → regime → reciprocity loss). What remained risky was a predictable reader error: treating a correct description as an automatic permission to <strong>bind</strong> others (“now we know what’s wrong, therefore we may enforce”). Without an explicit separation, PMS vocabulary can be smuggled into coercion while claiming “it’s just structure.”
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter installed a strict firewall: <strong>Χ (distance) is not a truth condition; it is a binding condition.</strong> We formalized two domains—(1) descriptive operator mapping and (2) PMS-valid application—and gave an explicit “paragraph test” for when discourse crosses into <strong>Ψ→Other</strong> (externalized obligation), irreversibility, or normativity externalization. This makes the paper audit-ready: readers can see <em>exactly</em> when PMS is merely describing and when someone tries to turn description into obligation.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 13):</strong>
				With the separation secured, we can now safely present a <strong>pattern library</strong>: recurring drift configurations that can be recognized descriptively without becoming prescriptive. Chapter 13 operationalizes recognition <strong>without crossing the gate</strong>: it provides comparable pattern records (trigger / stabilizer / failure) while keeping application validity explicitly conditioned by §12.
			</p>

			<h2>13. Structural Risks &amp; Drift Patterns (Pattern Library)</h2>
			<h3>13.1 Use-Condition Reminder (PMS validity)</h3>
			<p>This library is <strong>descriptive</strong> unless explicitly used for binding or prescription. For the application validity gate (<strong>Χ (distance) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling)</strong>), see <strong>§12.2.2</strong>.</p>
			<h4>Pattern Record Discipline (C5: 3-line schema)</h4>
			<p>For every pattern entry in this library, the following <strong>mandatory 3-line record</strong> is stated explicitly (even if the details also appear elsewhere in the pattern text):</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> the operator constellation that initiates the drift (what must be present / missing for drift to start).</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> the operator that makes the drift repeatable and durable (<strong>usually Α (attractor)</strong>; sometimes □/Φ/Λ as support surfaces).</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> the operator(s) whose absence/misuse constitutes the core functional failure (<strong>typically Σ and/or Ψ and/or Χ</strong>, sometimes D).</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a <strong>structural schema</strong>, not an instruction to act. It is used to keep pattern descriptions comparable and audit-ready.</p>

			<h3>13.3 P-Ω-AC — Ω → Covert Authority (Authority Capture)</h3>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
				Real <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient)</strong> is <strong>not regulated</strong> as a functional gradient; it becomes <strong>covert authority</strong> managed by <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> control.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> high and consequence-legible, with <strong>□ (frame)</strong> drifting into value-relation (ranking) and <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> not forming.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as repeatable indirect-steering script (often supported by <strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong> residues).</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> low/blocked and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> displaced (binding becomes unilateral/implicit rather than self-bound and mutually coordinable).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator signature (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> high / legible in consequences (what happens reveals gradients)</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> shifts from praxis-relation to value-relation (coordination → ranking)</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> stabilizes indirect steering as a repeatable script</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> low or blocked (no coherent coordination)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> displaced (binding becomes unilateral or implicit)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal, stepwise):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is present as a capacity/exposure gradient.</li>
				<li>Explicit coordination is avoided; <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> does not form.</li>
				<li>Control shifts to <strong>frame-management (□)</strong> and often to residue leverage via <strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong> (“unstated debts”).</li>
				<li>Repetition stabilizes as <strong>Α (attractor)</strong>: indirect governance becomes “normal.”</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Early warnings (signals):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>recurring “obviousness” claims replacing explicit coordination (“it should be clear”) → <strong>□ (frame)</strong> used as authority surface</li>
				<li>sanctions via mood, silence, or social framing rather than stated obligations → <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> operationalized as tool</li>
				<li>repeated <em>role-effects without role-speech</em>: <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> acts, but <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> cannot be named as a functional gradient</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Costs (structural, not moral):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>action-space collapses into permission-seeking</li>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> degrades because <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is handled without <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and without <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> restraint</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Viability signatures (PMS-valid application only under §12 gate; non-moral):</strong></p>
			<p>These are <strong>operator-readable viability signatures</strong> (descriptive). If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies (see §12.2.2).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ω becomes more governable when it is <strong>named functionally</strong> (capacity / exposure / obligation gradients) rather than moralized.</li>
				<li>Σ becomes more likely to form when coordination is expressed as <strong>explicit interfaces</strong> (division of responsibility, agreed constraints) rather than implied authority.</li>
				<li>Ψ becomes stabilizing when it is <strong>Ψ→Self</strong> (adopted as one’s own commitment) rather than <strong>Ψ→Other</strong> (binding imposed as demand).</li>
				<li>Χ becomes protective when it appears as <strong>limits that preserve reversibility</strong> (cooling protocols, reversible commitments, explicit exit clauses).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>13.4 P-Λ-DN — Λ → Denial / Suppression (“Nothing happened”)</h3>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
				A <strong>Λ (non-event: expectation violation / structured absence / non-closure)</strong> is treated as <em>non-existent</em> to avoid immediate conflict costs, but remains structurally active and returns as chronic tension.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> present with <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> demanding closure without consequence-tracking, while <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is not allowed to convert remainder into repair.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as avoidance script, supported by recurring <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> “repairs” that do not enact coordination.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> low/absent (no repair synthesis), with <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> not binding the system to explicit repair commitments across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator signature (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> present (something expected did not occur)</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> forbids explicit consequence-tracking (closure demanded without repair)</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> repeatedly reframes away the remainder (“not important,” “misunderstanding”)</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory / time)</strong> accumulates unresolved residue (history stacks)</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> stabilizes avoidance as default script</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Something that should occur does not occur (<strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>).</li>
				<li>The system declares closure without <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> supplies narrative repairs that avoid repair work.</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> extends the remainder; <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> becomes chronic (“never enough”).</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes: avoidance becomes repeatable protocol.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Early warnings (signals):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>fast reframing after breaches without repair action (“let’s move on”) → <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> replacing <strong>Σ (integration)</strong></li>
				<li>recurring micro-residues with no addressable cause (complaints without object) → <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> stacking</li>
				<li>escalation over “small things” (Λ stacking effect) → residue surfacing elsewhere</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Costs (structural):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>coherence across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> becomes volatile because <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> is never converted into <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> repair work</li>
				<li>dissatisfaction becomes a system cost (permanent monitoring and correction under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Viability signatures (PMS-valid application only under §12 gate; non-moral):</strong></p>
			<p>These are <strong>operator-readable viability signatures</strong> (descriptive). If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies (see §12.2.2).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Λ becomes less chronic when it is <strong>tracked explicitly</strong> (what was expected, what did not happen, what remains open).</li>
				<li>Σ becomes more available when Λ is <strong>converted into repair work</strong> (repair steps, explicit renegotiation of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).</li>
				<li>Ψ becomes stabilizing when it <strong>binds to repair commitments</strong> (time-bounded and reversible under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>) rather than to denial.</li>
				<li>Χ becomes protective when it <strong>prevents retaliation while keeping Λ legible</strong> (distance as escalation brake, not as erasure).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>13.5 P-Σ-TOT — Σ → Totalization (Dogma / Closure)</h3>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
				<strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> is invoked to end uncertainty, but without <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and <strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> it hardens into closure: “the whole is decided; dissent is illegitimate.”
			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> pressure from <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> and/or <strong>Λ (non-event: non-closure)</strong> meets a demand for fast closure inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment)</strong> becomes irreversible enforcement (binding without reversibility), often stabilized by <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> as “final-answer” script.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> suppressed (no revision window) and <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> violated (standing reduced for dissent), converting <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> from coordination into closure-weapon.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator signature (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> high in rhetoric (claims of “integration”)</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> low / disallowed (no pause, no reflective revision)</li>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> violated (standing reduced for dissent)</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> suppressed (frame shifts treated as betrayal)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> becomes irreversible enforcement (binding without reversibility)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Complexity produces discomfort (pressure from <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> and/or <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>).</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is used as a closure operator (“we have the whole”), not as coordination synthesis.</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is removed to prevent revision; distance is punished.</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds the system to “final answers,” making revision illegitimate.</li>
				<li><strong>Δ (difference)</strong> alternatives become moralized (difference becomes disloyalty inside the frame).</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Early warnings (signals):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>“we already clarified” used to block legitimate re-evaluation (Σ-as-closure)</li>
				<li>disagreement reframed as immaturity or malice (misuse of model vocabulary; violates guardrails)</li>
				<li>irreversibility without consent: no exit, no revision, no distance (Χ removed)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Costs (structural):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>learning stops because <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> cannot operate (recontextualization becomes forbidden)</li>
				<li>reciprocity collapses because coordination becomes compliance (Σ becomes domination tool)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Viability signatures (PMS-valid application only under §12 gate; non-moral):</strong></p>
			<p>These are <strong>operator-readable viability signatures</strong> (descriptive). If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies (see §12.2.2).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Σ remains coordination (not closure) when it is treated as <strong>provisional integration</strong> with revision windows under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and recontextualization hooks (<strong>Φ</strong>).</li>
				<li>Χ remains a guardrail when <strong>distance is permitted without punishment</strong> (pause / reflection / re-check as reversible capacity).</li>
				<li>Ψ remains PMS-consistent when commitments include <strong>reversibility and renegotiation procedures</strong>, rather than irreversible enforcement.</li>
				<li>D remains intact when dissent does <strong>not</strong> reduce standing-in-practice (no status penalty for revision).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>13.6 P-Ψ-EXT — Ψ → Externalization (“You must…”)</h3>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
				<strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is displaced from the agent to the other: normativity is externalized as demand (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>: binding imposed on the other rather than adopted as self-binding).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> coordination pressure under <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong> with active <strong>Λ (non-event: residue/non-closure)</strong> and real <strong>Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure gradient)</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as repeatable demand cycle (“tests” / compliance loops), often maintained via <strong>□ (frame)</strong> as obligation surface.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> is not adopted as <strong>Ψ→Self</strong>; instead it is externalized (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>), with <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> bypassed and <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> replaced by compliance.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator signature (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ψ→Other</strong> dominates (“you must…”, “you owe…”)</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> bypassed (no reflective restraint before binding claims)</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> weaponized (power gradient used as obligation lever)</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> replaced by compliance tests (integration substituted by obedience)</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes demand cycles (repeatable entitlement script)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Unstable coordination generates pressure (often via <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> residue under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>).</li>
				<li>Instead of self-binding (<strong>Ψ→Self</strong>), the system demands binding from the other (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>).</li>
				<li>Compliance becomes the substitute for integration (<strong>Σ (integration)</strong>).</li>
				<li>Repeated demands stabilize (<strong>Α (attractor)</strong>) into entitlement protocols.</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Early warnings (signals):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>obligations asserted without mutual integration (“if you cared, you would…”) → <strong>Ψ→Other</strong></li>
				<li>responsibility treated as transferable rather than self-bound → <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> displaced</li>
				<li>constant tests replace shared planning → <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> replaced by control</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Costs (structural):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> collapses because the other becomes instrument under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong></li>
				<li>action-space narrows into appeasement or revolt (trajectory hardens under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Viability signatures (PMS-valid application only under §12 gate; non-moral):</strong></p>
			<p>These are <strong>operator-readable viability signatures</strong> (descriptive). If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies (see §12.2.2).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Ψ externalization becomes less likely when commitments are first stated as <strong>Ψ→Self</strong> (“what will I bind myself to do?”).</li>
				<li>Σ becomes more available when demands are translated into <strong>coordination proposals</strong> (interfaces, roles, schedules, limits) rather than compliance tests.</li>
				<li>Χ becomes protective when it is used <strong>before</strong> binding claims (delay, reflect, verify reversibility) rather than bypassed.</li>
				<li>Ω remains governable when gradients are kept <strong>explicit and functional</strong>, not smuggled as moral authority.</li>

			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>

				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as “verdict script” (standing control becomes the main coordination substitute), often supported by <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> insinuation.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is displaced into adjudication (verdicts instead of coordination), and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to identity/virtue narratives rather than to reversible coordination commitments.</li>

				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> becomes adjudication, not integration (closure through verdicts)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to identity/virtue narratives (commitment to being “right”)</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> used as insinuation (“you didn’t… therefore you are…”)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Coordination difficulty arises under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> and <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
				<li>Instead of functional role speech, the frame moralizes (<strong>□ (frame)</strong> becomes tribunal).</li>
				<li>Every act becomes evidence; every non-event (<strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>) becomes accusation.</li>

			<ul>
				<li>□ becomes less tribunal-like when it is reoriented back to <strong>praxis variables</strong> (tasks, roles, constraints, capacities) rather than rank/blame.</li>
				<li>Ω becomes coordinable when gradients are <strong>separated from verdict logic</strong> (named without assigning worth).</li>
				<li>Σ becomes integration again when it yields <strong>concrete coordination outputs</strong> (agreements, interface design) rather than moral closure.</li>
				<li>Ψ remains stabilizing when it binds to <strong>dignity-in-practice constraints (D)</strong> rather than purity/identity victory.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>13.8 P-Σ-SIM — Σ-Simulation instead of Integration (Pseudo-maturity)</h3>
			<p><strong>Definition:</strong>
				The appearance of integration is produced (coherent talk, mature vocabulary, “balanced” rhetoric), but the underlying structure remains unintegrated.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger / Stabilizer / Failure (C5 discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Trigger configuration:</strong> high incentive for “coherence display” inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong> with recurring <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> residues and conflict costs rising under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary stabilizer:</strong> <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> as performance script (talk replaces interface change), with <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> supplying endless reframes.</li>
				<li><strong>Primary failure:</strong> <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> remains low in enactment (no consolidation), and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to image-management rather than to observable, revisable commitments.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Operator signature (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> in discourse, <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> low in enactment (coherence performed, not realized)</li>
				<li><strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> overused (endless reframing) without consolidation into <strong>Σ (integration)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes performance scripts (repeatable “mature talk” protocol)</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> remains unresolved (open remainder persists under the surface)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> binds to image-management rather than commitments (appearance-binding)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Mechanism (minimal):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>Integration is socially rewarded; conflict is costly.</li>
				<li>The system performs coherence (<strong>Σ-simulation</strong>) without changing interfaces.</li>
				<li>Unresolved <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> accumulates, producing periodic breakdowns under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</li>
				<li>The cycle repeats; the performance becomes an attractor (<strong>Α (attractor)</strong>).</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Early warnings (signals):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>elegant explanations that do not change outcomes (<strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> without <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>)</li>
				<li>“meta” talk replacing repair work (performance substituting coordination)</li>
				<li>chronic recurrence of the same conflict in new words (<strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> remains active)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Costs (structural):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>trust decays over <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong> because coherence does not translate into <strong>E (action: integrated enactment; formally E = [Σ (integration), Θ (temporality), ∇ (impulse: directed tension)])</strong></li>
				<li>dissatisfaction becomes chronic system cost (monitoring without closure)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Viability signatures (PMS-valid application only under §12 gate; non-moral):</strong></p>
			<p>These are <strong>operator-readable viability signatures</strong> (descriptive). If enacted as guidance, the PMS entry condition applies (see §12.2.2).</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Σ becomes testable when it is audited via <strong>outputs</strong> (what agreements changed; what interfaces changed; what actions followed).</li>
				<li>Φ becomes supportive (not substitutive) when reframing is <strong>converted into Σ consolidation</strong> (fewer reframes; more interface commitments).</li>
				<li>Ψ becomes stabilizing when it binds to <strong>observable, time-bounded, revisable commitments</strong> rather than image-management.</li>
				<li>Χ becomes useful when it interrupts performance loops and re-enters <strong>praxis space</strong> (pause → re-specify constraints → revise).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>13.9 Meta-signature: Self-control &gt; other-control (PMS-safe orientation)</h3>
			<p>Across patterns, a recurring <strong>operator-readable viability signature</strong> is:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>[Ψ→Self (self-binding: adopt commitment as one’s own), Χ (distance: reflective inhibition), D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling)]</strong> enabling <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong>, with <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient)</strong> named functionally inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Anti-pattern (invalid application move):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>using PMS vocabulary to justify coercion, devaluation/humiliation, or irreversible demands
					(dominant <strong>Ψ→Other</strong>, suppressed <strong>Χ</strong>, violated <strong>D</strong>) — structurally <strong>invalid as PMS application</strong> (see §12.2.2).
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>13.10 Chapter Closure — Pattern recognition without person-diagnosis (and without automatic normativity)</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				After establishing the master drift trace (comparison-dominant <strong>□</strong> → PS → residual stabilization via <strong>Φ/Λ/Α</strong> → reciprocity loss), the paper still lacked a <strong>repeatable recognition instrument</strong>: a way to identify <em>which</em> drift configuration is operating in a scene without collapsing into (a) moral verdicts, (b) psychological person-diagnosis, or (c) covert prescriptions disguised as “just describing structure.” Without a standardized format, pattern talk becomes impressionistic and easily weaponized.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				This chapter provided a <strong>structured pattern library</strong> with an explicit comparability discipline (C5: <strong>Trigger / Primary stabilizer / Primary failure</strong>). The index plus the residual-stabilization triangle makes the shared logic legible: when <strong>Ω</strong> is real and <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong> are blocked or misbound, stabilization tends to reroute through <strong>Φ</strong> (rewrite), <strong>Λ</strong> (open remainder), and <strong>Α</strong> (protocolization), sometimes drifting toward devaluation as a low-cost substitute. Each pattern record isolates (i) the initiating constellation, (ii) what makes it repeatable, and (iii) the functional failure at its core—so scenes can be mapped <strong>operatorially</strong> rather than narratively or morally. Finally, §13.9 extracted the cross-pattern viability orientation: <strong>self-control over other-control</strong>—i.e., <strong>Ψ→Self + Χ + D</strong> enabling <strong>Σ</strong> under named <strong>Ω</strong> inside <strong>□</strong>—while explicitly tagging coercive “PMS-language” moves (dominant <strong>Ψ→Other</strong>, suppressed <strong>Χ</strong>, violated <strong>D</strong>) as <strong>invalid as PMS application</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (handoff to Ch. 14):</strong>
				With the library in place, the paper can now close at the whole-system level without adding new machinery: Chapter 14 will (1) restate the paper-wide claims in their tightest form, (2) summarize the consequence grammar (what becomes legible and costly under <strong>Ω/Θ/Λ</strong> once <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong> fail), and (3) present the counter-proposal signatures as <strong>non-prescriptive viability profiles</strong>—still strictly contained by the §12 application gate.

			<h2>14. Conclusion &amp; Summary (paper-wide; incl. counter-proposal signatures)</h2>
			<p><img alt="Diagram 1 — Master Drift Trace (pipeline)" src="img/diagram01.png">
				<em>Figure 1. Master drift trace (pipeline): Eden → threshold → NRK → □comparison → pseudo-symmetry → residual stabilization (Λ/Φ/Α) → possible devaluation/humiliation → reciprocity loss (Σ/Ψ failure under Ω across Θ).</em>
			</p>
			<h3>14.1 What the paper established (content)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Eden as a mature, non-deficit praxis frame:</strong>
						Eden is modeled as a <strong>non-scarcity</strong> configuration where <strong>A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time; formally A = [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)])</strong> is structurally available within <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> and does not require lack or deprivation as its engine. Distinctions <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> and impulses <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> remain possible without collapsing into deficit-compulsion.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>The Apple as threshold marker:</strong>
						The “Apple” functions as a threshold marker that renders <strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel; paper-internal composite / pattern label)</strong> explicit as an available option within <strong>[Δ (difference), □ (frame), Θ (temporality)]</strong>. This is <strong>not</strong> an epistemic gain (not <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position)</strong> treated as “knowledge”), but an <strong>option-visibility shift</strong>: a newly accessible pathway in the action grammar.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>The breach as chain interruption:</strong>
						The praxis breach is modeled as a <strong>break in the generative chain</strong>: enactment occurs despite <strong>A (awareness: [Θ (temporality), □ (frame), Δ (difference)])</strong> being available, because <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> is low/failed and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> is defective/refused/simulated. The key structural claim is not “ignorance,” but <strong>failed integration and binding under an emergent trajectory (Θ (temporality: trajectory/time))</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Post-breach drift sequence:</strong>
						After <strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel: breach under available A (awareness))</strong>, the system shifts into a <strong>comparison-dominant □ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>. Under that frame, <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation)</strong> becomes legible as a structural gradient, and this legibility produces systemic costs:
						<strong>comparison-dominant □ (frame) + Ω (asymmetry) legibility → dissatisfaction (system cost) → pseudo-symmetry (rhetorical equality under real Ω (asymmetry)) → loss of reciprocity (failure of Σ (integration) + Ψ (self-binding) under Ω (asymmetry)).</strong>
						Dissatisfaction is treated here as <strong>system cost</strong>, not as a defect state.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Regime form (postfeminist oversteering):</strong>
						A regime configuration emerges in which <strong>functional asymmetry Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure/obligation gradients) is prohibited as speakable object</strong> while <strong>real symmetry (reciprocity via Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) + Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) under Ω (asymmetry)) is blocked</strong>, producing a stable contradiction: <strong>over-order with simultaneous denial of asymmetry Ω (asymmetry)</strong>. Under these constraints, <strong>devaluation (status regulation via devaluation)</strong> becomes the remaining stabilization mode—understood strictly as <strong>residual stabilization</strong> when <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> cannot be named and <strong>Σ (integration) / Ψ (self-binding)</strong> cannot be built.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>14.2 Transitions and visibility logic (consequence grammar)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Breach makes Ω/Θ/Λ irreversibly legible:</strong>
						The breach does not primarily yield “insight,” but opens a <strong>consequence field</strong> in which <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradients)</strong>, <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong>, and <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> become <strong>structurally readable</strong> and persist across time. Irreversibility here is a property of <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>-extended trajectories: what occurs cannot be “un-occurred,” and the remainder <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> cannot be erased by narration alone.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Equating the structurally different forces perpetual monitoring:</strong>
						When what is structurally distinct <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> is forced into equivalence under <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> <strong>without functional coordination</strong>, the system must pay continuous maintenance costs:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>permanent comparison (<strong>□ (frame)</strong> used as comparison maintained against <strong>Δ (difference)</strong>)</li>
						<li>permanent adjustment (attempts to “re-level” <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> outcomes)</li>
						<li>permanent dissatisfaction (system cost of maintaining false equivalence across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>)
							Dissatisfaction is therefore modeled as a <strong>maintenance load</strong> required to keep the false equivalence stable under <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Blocked coordination stabilizes devaluation via Α:</strong>
						Where coordination is blocked—especially where <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> may not be named and <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> may not be built—<strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> stabilizes routines that reduce immediate conflict costs while preserving control. Devaluation is thereby understood as a <strong>stabilizing attractor (Α (attractor))</strong>: a repeatable script that closes uncertainty cheaply by lowering the other’s standing-in-practice, rather than by integrating the structure via <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and binding it via <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>14.3 Dedicated counter-proposal signatures (non-prescriptive; viability profiles)</h3>
			<p>These are not instructions and not moral claims. They are <strong>structural viability profiles</strong>: recognizable operator configurations that can support stability without requiring pseudo-symmetry or devaluation. They remain subject to the PMS entry condition for application: <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong>.</p>
			<h4>G1 — Functional asymmetry coordination</h4>
			<p>A viable configuration in which asymmetry is <strong>named and coordinated</strong> rather than denied.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Core signature (operator-readable):</strong>
						<code>[Ω named functionally, Σ built, Ψ mutual durability, Χ as escalation brake]</code> within reversibility and <strong>D (dignity-in-practice constraints on Ω-handling)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Structural effect (plain language):</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> becomes governable rather than weaponizable</li>
						<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> converts conflict into interface work (coordination)</li>
						<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> stabilizes commitments so coordination persists across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong></li>
						<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> prevents impulse <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> from forcing immediate control moves</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Viability marker:</strong>
						Stability is achieved by <strong>coordination (Σ (integration))</strong>, not by suppression of <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> or rhetorical leveling.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>G2 — Symmetry as reciprocity-binding (not as equivalence)</h4>
			<p>A viable notion of symmetry that does not require denial of <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> or flattening of <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural gradient)</strong>.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Core signature (operator-readable):</strong>
						<code>symmetry = [bilateral Ψ constraints, Χ + reversibility windows, D constraints] under real Ω (asymmetry)</code> (reciprocity, not equivalence).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Structural clarification (plain language; descriptive viability profile):</strong>
						If such a configuration is used as guidance, symmetry does not mean “we are the same,” but
						an operator-readable reciprocity structure in which:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>both sides adopt self-binding constraints (<strong>Ψ→Self</strong>) on how <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> may be handled (<strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong>),</li>
						<li>both sides preserve revision windows (<strong>Χ (distance)</strong> + reversibility),</li>
						<li>both sides remain committed to repair obligations via <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>,</li>
					</ul>
					<p>while <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> and <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> may remain functionally real and fully speakable.</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h4>G3 — Frame recontextualization (from value-relation to praxis-relation)</h4>
			<p>A viable shift in the dominant frame away from tribunal logic and toward interface logic.</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Core signature (operator-readable):</strong>
						<code>Φ (recontextualization) reorients □ from value-relation to praxis-relation</code> (so Ω can be named functionally and Σ-work can consolidate).
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Structural effect (plain language):</strong></p>
					<ul>
						<li><strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence)</strong> is treated as a coordination remainder, not as a permanent lack-object</li>
						<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is described functionally rather than morally</li>
						<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> becomes possible without immediate status war inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong></li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Viability marker:</strong>
						The system stops paying constant comparison costs because <strong>□ (frame)</strong> no longer demands equivalence maintenance against <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.
					</p>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>14.4 Closing formula (short; without moralization)</h3>
			<blockquote>
				<p><strong>Eden was not lost through knowledge, but through a deliberate breach of praxis that made consequences irreversibly legible and replaced functional asymmetry (Ω (asymmetry: capacity/exposure gradients)) with soothing pseudo-symmetry (rhetorical equality under real Ω (asymmetry))—resulting in the loss of reciprocity (failure of Σ (integration) + Ψ (self-binding) under Ω (asymmetry)) for both.</strong></p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>14.5 Final Closure — What the paper gives, and what it refuses to do</h3>
			<p><strong>What we needed (problem):</strong>
				At the end, the paper must answer the reader’s implicit question—“what does this <em>ultimately</em> establish?”—without collapsing into theology, psychology, or moral blame. A conclusion here must preserve the paper’s core discipline: structural clarity without coercive application.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What we achieved (result):</strong>
				We delivered a complete operator trace: Eden as a mature non-deficit frame; the threshold as option-explicitness; NRK as chain interruption; post-breach consequence-legibility (Ω/Θ/Λ); comparison-dominant □ as drift engine; pseudo-symmetry as substitution regime; regime-level override as repeatability hypothesis; and reciprocity loss as <strong>Σ/Ψ erosion under Ω across Θ with chronic Λ</strong>, often stabilized by Φ/Λ/Α rerouting. We then offered counter-proposal signatures as <strong>viability profiles</strong>, not prescriptions, and explicitly contained them under the §12 application gate.
			</p>
			<p><strong>What follows (post-paper use constraint):</strong>
				The only “next step” consistent with PMS is methodological: if readers use any of these signatures in practice, they must do so <strong>only</strong> under <strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>, and must resist the temptation to convert diagnosis into verdict. The paper ends by design where coercion would normally begin: it gives a map, and it locks the gate.

			<h2>15. Methodological Appendix (EDEN-MAP)</h2>
			<h3>15.1 Purpose and Validity Window</h3>
			<p>EDEN-MAP is a <strong>structural mapping protocol</strong> for PMS–EDEN analyses.
				It identifies operator configurations (<strong>Δ–Ψ (PMS operators: difference through self-binding)</strong>) in a given scene <strong>without diagnosing persons</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Validity constraint (PMS entry condition):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mapping can remain purely <strong>descriptive</strong> (operator attribution) without becoming <strong>binding</strong> (normative steering).</li>
				<li>Any <strong>application</strong> that prescribes, binds, obligates, or demands must preserve <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) + reversibility + D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong>.</li>
				<li>Uses that suspend <strong>Χ (distance)</strong>, reversibility, or <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> are <strong>formally invalid as PMS application</strong>, even if PMS vocabulary is used.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Question-only clause (method discipline):</strong>
				The following sections provide <strong>mapping prompts</strong> (questions) and <strong>recording templates</strong> (structured outputs). They do not authorize binding, demands, sanctions, or coercive “use against” persons or roles.
			</p>
			<h3>15.2 Minimal Unit of Analysis (Scene Packet)</h3>
			<p><strong>What is the minimal packet needed to map a scene structurally (without person diagnosis)?</strong>
				A scene packet is a compact record capturing operator-relevant elements in a bounded window:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Scene ID:</strong> What is the time span (<strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time) window</strong>), what anchors the context (<strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong>), and who appears as <strong>roles</strong> (not persons)?</li>
				<li><strong>Trigger (Δ/∇):</strong> Which <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> activated which <strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong>?</li>
				<li><strong>Expected events:</strong> What “should have happened” under the dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> (i.e., which <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> candidates were created)?</li>
				<li><strong>Observed realizations (enactments, neutral):</strong> What behaviors, omissions, or escalations occurred (operator-relevant realizations). Separately record whether—if at all—the scene meets <strong>E (action: integrated enactment; Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) + Θ (temporality) + ∇ (impulse))</strong>.<br><strong>Discipline:</strong> realization/enactment <strong>≠ E</strong> unless <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> carries the act (and binding is not outsourced as Ψ→Other).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Recording template (scene packet; paper-standard):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>

				<li><strong>Comparison frame (□comparison):</strong> equivalence talk, ranking pressure, symmetry demands; accounting-first relevance.</li>
				<li><strong>Moral frame (□moral):</strong> tribunal logic, blame/purity, standing as control; verdict-first relevance.</li>

			</ul>
			<p><strong>Indicators (plain language):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>What counts as “relevant” is set by <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
				<li>What is speakable/unspeakable is set by <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
				<li>What is punished/rewarded is set by <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output format (□ statement):</strong>
				<code>□dominant (frame: contextual constraint) = &lt;type or hybrid&gt;</code> + 1–2 sentences specifying what the frame permits/forbids.
			</p>
			<h4>Q2 — What asymmetry (Ω) is real?</h4>
			<p><strong>What Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation/leverage) is real in consequences—mapped as gradients, not verdicts?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Ω gradient map (paper-standard):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Capacity gradient (Ωcapacity):</strong> Who can do more / carry more without breaking?</li>
				<li><strong>Exposure gradient (Ωexposure):</strong> Who is more vulnerable to loss, shame, sanctions inside the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>?</li>
				<li><strong>Obligation gradient (Ωobligation):</strong> Who is structurally expected to stabilize outcomes (repair, plan, contain, provide)?</li>
				<li><strong>Leverage gradient (Ωleverage):</strong> Who can set <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, open/close <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence)</strong>, and stabilize <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> scripts?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output format (Ω statement):</strong>
				<code>Ωreal (asymmetry: structural imbalance) = {capacity: …, exposure: …, obligation: …, leverage: …}</code>
			</p>
			<p><strong>Legibility note (structural, not moral):</strong>
				Is <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> currently <strong>Ω-legible</strong> (nameable and coordinable in a praxis-use of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>), or <strong>Ω-taboo/Ω-illegible</strong> (treated as illegitimate to name inside the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>)?
			</p>
			<h4>Q3 — Which Λ is suppressed or forcibly closed?</h4>
			<p><strong>Which Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure) is active, and how is it handled (closed, denied, displaced, or pseudo-closed)?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Non-event classes (Λ candidates):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Reply missing:</strong> silence where response is expected.</li>
				<li><strong>Repair missing:</strong> breach not repaired.</li>
				<li><strong>Recognition missing:</strong> standing not acknowledged.</li>
				<li><strong>Coordination missing:</strong> role speech avoided (interfaces not stated).</li>
				<li><strong>Commitment missing:</strong> promised binding not enacted across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Closure modes (how Λ is handled):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Denial:</strong> “nothing happened.”</li>
				<li><strong>Minimization:</strong> “not important.”</li>
				<li><strong>Moralization (via □moral):</strong> “you are the kind of person who…”</li>
				<li><strong>Displacement:</strong> a new conflict replaces the old remainder.</li>
				<li><strong>Pseudo-closure:</strong> rhetorical resolution without interface change (often <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> simulated rather than realized).</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output format (Λ statement):</strong>
				<code>Λactive (non-event: structured absence) = &lt;type&gt;</code>
				<code>Λhandling (non-event handling) = &lt;closure mode&gt;</code>
				<code>Λremainder (what persists across Θ (temporality)) = &lt;what remains active&gt;</code>

			<h4>Q4 — Where is Χ missing, and where is Χ instrumentalized?</h4>
			<p><strong>Where is Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position) absent or punished, and where is Χ (distance) instrumentalized as control rather than restraint?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Χ absent / punished (Χ missing):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where do escalation loops run without attenuation (e.g., <strong>∇ (impulse)</strong> → <strong>□ (frame)</strong> → <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> with no braking <strong>Χ (distance)</strong>)?</li>
				<li>Where are timeouts, pauses, or revision windows (Θ-bounded reflection) disallowed under <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>?</li>
				<li>Where is dissent treated as betrayal rather than legitimate distance (<strong>Χ denied</strong>)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Χ instrumentalized (Χ used as control technique rather than restraint):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Where is “be calm” used to dominate while <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> acts unilaterally?</li>
				<li>Where is “don’t overreact” used to erase <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> residues?</li>
				<li>Where is “take distance” demanded to avoid <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> work while maintaining leverage (<strong>Ωleverage</strong>)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output format (Χ statement):</strong>
				<code>Χabsent (distance missing) = &lt;where and how&gt;</code>
				<code>Χinstrumental (distance misused) = &lt;where and by which role-position / control-surface&gt;</code>
				<code>Χrestoration (distance restoration) = &lt;minimal step that makes distance reversible and dignity-preserving (D)&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<h4>Q5 — Where is Σ low/failed (or simulated)?</h4>
			<p><strong>Where is Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis) low/failed, suppressed, or simulated—and what blocks integration in this scene?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Σ low/failed (integration not achieved):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is role speech avoided such that only moods, accusations, or standing operations remain (coordination without interface)?</li>
				<li>Do repeated reframes via <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> occur without consolidation into <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>?</li>
				<li>Do agreements exist only as aspiration (talk) rather than interface (enacted change)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Σ simulated (pseudo-integration):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Is coherent talk present while outcomes and interfaces do not change?</li>
				<li>Is “we clarified” used as closure while <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> remains active?</li>
				<li>Is maturity language used as substitute for repair actions (Σ performed, not built)?</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Output format (Σ statement):</strong>
				<code>Σstatus (integration status) = low | failed | suppressed | simulated | partial | functional</code>
				<code>Σblockers (integration blockers) = {□ (frame): …, Ω (asymmetry): …, Λ (non-event): …, Θ (temporality): …}</code>
				<code>Σminimum (minimal integration step) = &lt;one concrete interface move that would count as integration&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<h4>Q6 — Who self-binds (Ψ), and who externalizes binding?</h4>
			<p><strong>Who adopts Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time) as self-obligation, and where is binding externalized as Ψ→Other (demand: “you must…”)—and how is binding enforced?</strong></p>
			<p><strong>Ψ self-binding (Ψ→Self):</strong>
				Ψ (self-binding) adopted as self-obligation under <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and <strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong>.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ externalization (Ψ→Other):</strong>
				Ψ (self-binding) displaced as demand: binding outsourced as “you must…” (often bypassing <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and replacing <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> with compliance tests).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ mapping layers (three-layer map):</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li><strong>Declared Ψ:</strong> What is said to be binding?</li>
				<li><strong>Enacted Ψ:</strong> What is actually carried across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong>?</li>
				<li><strong>Enforced Ψ:</strong> How is binding maintained—via self-restraint (Χ + D), or via coercion-by-frame (<strong>□ (frame)</strong>) and leverage (<strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>)?</li>
			</ol>
			<p><strong>Output format (Ψ statement):</strong>
				<code>Ψself (self-binding) = &lt;who binds themselves to what&gt;</code>
				<code>Ψexternal (externalized binding) = &lt;who demands binding from whom&gt;</code>
				<code>Ψrepair (binding repair) = &lt;shift binding from other-control to self-control, preserving reversibility and D&gt;</code>
			</p>
			<h3>15.4 Synthesis Output (One-Page Result Format)</h3>
			<p><strong>What compact synthesis follows from Q1–Q6 (operator-readable, non-diagnostic)?</strong></p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Dominant drift vector (operator-readable):</strong>
						<code>Drift = □dominant (frame) → Λhandling (non-event handling) → Αstabilizer (attractor) → Ωmanagement (asymmetry handling) → Σstatus (integration) → Ψpattern (self-binding or externalization)</code>
					</p>

				<li>
					<p><strong>Primary attractor (Α):</strong>
						What repetition keeps the configuration stable (even if costly), stated as <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> in plain language.
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><strong>Cost profile (system costs; structural, not moral):</strong></p>
				</li>
			</ol>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A (awareness: Θ (temporality) + □ (frame) + Δ (difference)) costs:</strong> option visibility and monitoring load.</li>
				<li><strong>C (coherence: Θ (temporality) + Λ (non-event) + □ (frame) + ∇ (impulse)) costs:</strong> coherence volatility vs stabilization.</li>
				<li><strong>R (responsibility: Ψ (self-binding) + Φ (recontextualization) + Θ (temporality) + Ω (asymmetry)) costs:</strong> responsibility clarity vs outsourcing.</li>
				<li><strong>E (action: Σ (integration) + Θ (temporality) + ∇ (impulse)) costs:</strong> integrated enactment bandwidth vs suppression (note: E requires Σ-carriage).</li>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: Ψ (self-binding) ∘ Χ (distance) ∘ Ω (asymmetry)) costs:</strong> restraint/protection load vs degradation-in-practice risk when Χ/D are bypassed.</li>
			</ul>
			<ol start="4">
				<li><strong>Lowest-cost correction signature (operator-readable; descriptive):</strong>
					This is a <strong>viability signature</strong>, not a prescription. It describes the smallest operator moves that <em>would tend to reopen coordination</em> <strong>if</strong> the analysis is used as guidance. Any actual application must pass the validity gate (<strong>Χ + reversibility + D</strong>) (see <strong>§12.2.2</strong>).
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>Which minimal steps would simultaneously address the following three questions?</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ step:</strong> Which step restores <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> without erasing <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>?</li>
				<li><strong>Λ→Σ step:</strong> Which step converts one active <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> into <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> work (an interface move)?</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ shift:</strong> Which step relocates <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> from other-control (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>) to self-binding (<strong>Ψ→Self</strong>), preserving reversibility and <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong>?</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>15.5 Diagnostics-to-Action Firewall (Mandatory Guardrail)</h3>
			<p>EDEN-MAP is <strong>not</strong> a person-evaluation tool.</p>
			<p>Allowed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>structural mapping of roles, frames, non-events, and binding patterns (Δ–Ψ operators in-scene)</li>
				<li>identification of drift risks and stabilization costs (structural costs under Θ (temporality))</li>
				<li>reversible, dignity-preserving counter-measures (<strong>Χ (distance)</strong> + reversibility + <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong>)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Not allowed:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>global labels about persons</li>
				<li>claims of inner states, traits, or clinical categories</li>
				<li>coercive prescriptions justified by PMS vocabulary (Ψ→Other externalization under suppressed Χ)</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>15.6 Meta-Notes (Operational Constraints)</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Clarity ≠ humiliation:</strong> naming operators can be precise without degrading standing (<strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> remains active as an application constraint).</li>
				<li><strong>Naming ≠ moralizing:</strong> <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> / <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence)</strong> / <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> can be specified functionally without verdict logic.</li>
				<li><strong>Firmness ≠ dignity break:</strong> boundaries can be enacted with <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and reversibility; hardness becomes a dignity violation only when <strong>D (dignity-in-practice)</strong> is suspended.</li>
			</ul>
			<div class="pagebreak"></div>
			<h2>16. Terminology &amp; Structural Glossary</h2>
			<p>This section defines <strong>paper-internal structural terms</strong> used in PMS–EDEN. Definitions are operator-conform and non-psychological. The goal is <strong>terminology discipline</strong>, not pedagogy or persuasion.</p>
			<p><strong>Scope note (discipline):</strong><br>All terms below are <strong>structural operators or operator-derived composites</strong>. They are <strong>not</strong> diagnoses, traits, inner-state claims, or moral evaluations. Where a term has everyday psychological connotations (e.g., “maturity,” “humiliation”), the paper’s use is <strong>strictly formal/structural</strong> and limited to <strong>in-scene consequence structure</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Notation note (paper-wide discipline):</strong><br>Throughout this paper, <code>+</code> denotes <strong>operator co-availability / compositional participation</strong> (a compact way to state that multiple operators are jointly active/required in-scene). It is <strong>not</strong> arithmetic addition and not a causal operator by itself.<br>Where <code>∘</code> is used (e.g., dignity constraints), it denotes <strong>constraint/application order</strong> (a restraint operator applied to the handling of another operator), not function composition in a mathematical proof sense.</p>
			<h3>16.1 Awareness (A)</h3>
			<p><strong>Awareness (A)</strong> is defined strictly as <strong>sustained, framed differentiation across time</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>A (awareness: sustained, framed differentiation across time)</strong>
					<strong>A = Θ (temporality: trajectory/time) + □ (frame: contextual constraint) + Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Awareness denotes <strong>operator availability</strong>, not phenomenology: it specifies that distinctions <strong>Δ (difference)</strong> remain legible within a frame <strong>□ (frame)</strong> across a temporal horizon <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Non-psychological clause (mandatory):</strong>
				“A is available” means: the system’s option-set remains differentiable and trackable across time in the current frame. It does <strong>not</strong> assert a person’s insight, sincerity, or subjective experience.
			</p>
			<h3>16.2 Maturity</h3>
			<p><strong>Maturity</strong> (paper-internal) is defined as <strong>structural availability of Awareness A</strong> within a frame:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Maturity = A-availability</strong> inside <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong> with <strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> remaining legible.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Non-psychological clause (mandatory):</strong>
				This definition makes no claim about traits, inner states, “developmental level,” or diagnostics. It specifies only an operator-availability condition.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Stability note (discipline):</strong>
				“Maturity” here can vary by scene: it is <strong>local and conditional</strong> (frame- and time-bound), not global and not person-fixed.
			</p>
			<h3>16.3 Explicitness and Possibility Space</h3>
			<p><strong>Explicitness / possibility space</strong> denotes <strong>option visibility</strong> generated by differentiation within a framed temporal horizon:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Explicitness = option visibility via Δ (difference: minimal distinction) within □ (frame: contextual constraint) across Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Non-equivalence clause (mandatory):</strong>
				Explicitness is <strong>not equivalent</strong> to Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position).
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is an inhibition/withdrawal stance relevant to <strong>binding validity</strong> (what may be prescribed or demanded).</li>
				<li>Explicitness is a visibility property of the option-set under <strong>Δ/□/Θ</strong>, independent of whether <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is enacted.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Practical distinction (operator discipline):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>Explicitness can increase (more options visible) while Χ decreases (less restraint).</li>
				<li>Χ can increase (more restraint) while explicitness remains unchanged (same options visible).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>16.4 Frame (□)</h3>
			<p><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint / relevance structuring)</strong> specifies what counts as relevant, speakable, and sanctionable in a scene. In PMS–EDEN, “frame” is not a belief; it is a <strong>selection grammar</strong> for what can be treated as an object of coordination.</p>
			<p><strong>Common frame-uses (paper-internal labels, still □):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□praxis (praxis frame):</strong> tasks, interfaces, constraints, capacities; coordination first.</li>
				<li><strong>□comparison (comparison frame):</strong> equivalence talk, ranking pressure, symmetry demands; accounting first.</li>
				<li><strong>□moral (moral frame):</strong> tribunal logic, blame/purity, standing as control; verdict first.</li>
				<li><strong>□narrative (narrative frame):</strong> story coherence prioritized over interface repair; meaning-first stabilization.</li>
				<li><strong>□security (security frame):</strong> threat avoidance, risk minimization; safety-first steering.</li>
				<li><strong>□scarcity (scarcity frame):</strong> competition for limited resources/attention; zero-sum legibility.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Speakability / illegibility (paper-internal):</strong>
				A term is “unspeakable” when the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong> treats it as illegitimate to name, track, or coordinate (for example: an <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> taboo inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).
			</p>
			<h3>16.5 Difference (Δ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Δ (difference: minimal distinction)</strong> denotes the smallest structurally relevant contrast that can be referenced inside a frame <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<p>In PMS–EDEN, Δ is <strong>not</strong> valuation, ranking, or essence. Differences can be functional distinctions without being converted into worth signals.</p>
			<p><strong>Note (discipline):</strong>
				Δ becomes risky primarily when a dominant <strong>□comparison</strong> or <strong>□moral</strong> converts it into rank/standing operations.
			</p>
			<h3>16.6 Impulse (∇)</h3>
			<p><strong>∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong> denotes directed movement/pressure toward realization. It can operate without deficit pressure in Eden and can drive enactment even when <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis)</strong> is low.</p>
			<p>Impulse is not a “drive theory.” It is a structural tension operator.</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification (consistency):</strong>
				Impulse <strong>∇</strong> is not itself “good” or “bad”; drift arises when ∇ couples into <strong>□/Ω</strong> without restraint via <strong>Χ</strong> and without consolidation via <strong>Σ/Ψ</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>16.7 Action (E) vs Enactment/Realization (terminology discipline)</h3>
			<p><strong>E (action: integrated enactment)</strong> is defined in PMS as:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>E (action: integrated enactment)</strong>
					<strong>E = Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis) + Θ (temporality: trajectory/time) + ∇ (impulse: directed tension)</strong>
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Enactment/realization (paper usage):</strong>
				The paper uses “enactment/realization” as a neutral label for observable realizations (acts/omissions/escalations) <strong>regardless</strong> of whether they are integrated.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Discipline (hard separation):</strong>
				Enactment/realization <strong>≠ E</strong> unless <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> carries the act (and binding is not outsourced as <strong>Ψ→Other</strong>).<br>This is a structural criterion, not a claim about inner states.
			</p>
			<h3>16.8 Temporality (Θ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong> denotes time as a <strong>consequence carrier</strong>: sequences become path-dependent, and accumulated residues remain active across scenes.</p>
			<p><strong>Irreversibility (paper-internal):</strong>
				A condition becomes “irreversible” when <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> makes prior events non-resettable and their residues non-erasable by narration alone (especially when <strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence)</strong> persists).
			</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification (consistency):</strong>
				“Irreversible” here means: <em>the event cannot be undone as an event in the trajectory.</em> It does not mean repair is impossible; it means repair cannot restore a “never-happened” state.
			</p>
			<h3>16.9 Non-Event (Λ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Λ (non-event: meaningful absence / structured absence / non-closure)</strong> denotes what <em>should</em> occur under a frame <strong>□ (frame)</strong> but does not occur, while remaining structurally active.</p>
			<p><strong>Closure modes (paper-internal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>denial (“nothing happened”)</li>
				<li>minimization (“not important”)</li>
				<li>displacement (new conflict replaces the remainder)</li>
				<li>pseudo-closure (rhetorical resolution without interface change; often <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> simulated)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Λ matters in PMS–EDEN because it can become a chronic remainder across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> and can be operationalized as leverage inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Consistency note (closure vocabulary):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li>“Closure” in this paper means <strong>conversion of remainder into Σ-work</strong> (repair/renegotiation).</li>
				<li>“Pseudo-closure” means <strong>narrated closure without interface change</strong> (Λ remains active).</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>16.10 Asymmetry (Ω)</h3>
			<p><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance of capacity/exposure/obligation/leverage)</strong> denotes gradients that are real in consequences (who can do more, who is more exposed, who is expected to stabilize, who can steer the frame).</p>
			<p><strong>Ω map (paper-standard gradients):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ωcapacity (capacity gradient):</strong> who can carry more without breaking</li>
				<li><strong>Ωexposure (exposure gradient):</strong> who is more vulnerable to loss/sanction inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Ωobligation (obligation gradient):</strong> who is structurally expected to stabilize outcomes</li>
				<li><strong>Ωleverage (leverage gradient):</strong> who can set <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, open/close <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>, stabilize <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Legibility vs weaponization (paper-internal):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω-legible</strong> means the gradient can be named and coordinated in a praxis-use of <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</li>
				<li><strong>Ω-weaponized</strong> means the gradient is converted into control, accusation, or standing operations instead of coordination.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Clarification (underexplained previously):</strong>
				Ω-legibility is not “admitting guilt” or “assigning blame.” It is the minimal condition for turning gradients into <strong>interfaces</strong> rather than <strong>covert governance</strong>.
			</p>
			<h3>16.11 Pseudo-Symmetry (PS)</h3>
			<p><strong>Pseudo-symmetry (PS)</strong> is a paper-internal structural label for <strong>rhetorical equality inside a comparison-dominant □ (frame)</strong> under <strong>real Ω (asymmetry)</strong> in consequences.</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal signature (paper usage):</strong>
				PS typically involves: <strong>□comparison dominance + Ω real (gradient persists) + Σ (integration) blocked/simulated + Ψ (self-binding) misbound to appearance-management</strong>, often supported by <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> and stabilized by <strong>Α (attractor)</strong>.
			</p>
			<p>PS is not a moral accusation; it is a drift description: rhetorical parity substitutes for functional coordination under named gradients.</p>
			<h3>16.12 Postfeminist Over-Steering / Override (PFO)</h3>
			<p><strong>Postfeminist over-steering / override (PFO)</strong> is a <strong>paper-internal regime label</strong>, defined structurally (not ideologically, not as a group/person label).</p>
			<p><strong>Regime definition (paper usage):</strong>
				PFO denotes a dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong> that simultaneously:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>treats <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> as taboo/illegible (unspeakable as a functional gradient),</li>
				<li>and blocks consolidation of <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and explicit <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> required for reciprocity under real Ω,
					while relying heavily on <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> and persistent <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> residues, stabilized as <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> scripts.
				</li>
			</ul>
			<p>This is a descriptive regime hypothesis; it does not imply political identity, motives, or moral ranking.</p>
			<h3>16.13 Humiliation (PMS–EDEN internal use)</h3>
			<p><strong>Humiliation</strong> in PMS–EDEN is a paper-internal structural term meaning <strong>status regulation via devaluation</strong> as a residual stabilization mode.</p>
			<p><strong>Trigger condition (mandatory; paper usage):</strong>
				Humiliation tends to become available as a stabilization shortcut when <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is action-relevant but cannot be coordinatively governed through <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> (blocked/suppressed/misbound within the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).
			</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Safeguard (important):</strong>
				Calling a configuration “humiliation” does not license humiliation. It is a <strong>diagnostic label for a structural stabilization mode</strong>, not a normative tool.
			</p>
			<h3>16.14 Integration (Σ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> denotes the synthesis that converts differences and tensions into workable interfaces, role coordination, and stable commitments.</p>
			<p><strong>Σ low/failed (paper-internal):</strong> integration does not occur; coordination remains moods, accusations, or narratives without interface change.</p>
			<p><strong>Σ suppressed (paper-internal):</strong> the dominant <strong>□ (frame)</strong> penalizes explicit coordination work (for example under an <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> taboo), preventing synthesis from consolidating.</p>
			<p><strong>Σ simulated (Σ-simulation / pseudo-integration):</strong> coherent talk and “maturity vocabulary” appear, but outcomes and interfaces do not change; <strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift)</strong> substitutes for real integration.</p>
			<p><strong>Consistency improvement:</strong>
				Keep the three cases distinct:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>low/failed:</strong> cannot build Σ (capacity/skill/availability issue inside the scene)</li>
				<li><strong>suppressed:</strong> Σ is punishable/illegitimate inside □ (frame constraint)</li>
				<li><strong>simulated:</strong> Σ is performed to gain stability without doing interface work</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>16.15 Self-Binding (Ψ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> denotes commitment as a self-adopted obligation that persists across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong> and remains compatible with <strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> and dignity constraints.</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ→Self (paper-internal):</strong> binding is adopted as self-commitment (“what I will do / refrain from doing”), preserving reversibility.</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ→Other (externalized binding):</strong> binding is outsourced as demand (“you must …”), often bypassing <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and replacing coordination <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> with compliance tests.</p>
			<p><strong>Ψ misbound (paper-internal):</strong> binding attaches to appearance-management, avoidance, or narrative repair instead of to coordinated praxis (for example: binding to “seeming fair” inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>).</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification (underexplained previously):</strong>
				Ψ can be “strong” but misbound (high durability, wrong object). The question is not intensity but <strong>target and validity</strong> (Ψ under Χ + reversibility + D).
			</p>
			<h3>16.16 Distance (Χ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition / meta-position)</strong> denotes inhibition, withdrawal, or spacing that limits escalation and preserves revision capacity.</p>
			<p><strong>Core rule (paper-wide):</strong><br><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> is a condition for <strong>binding validity</strong>, not a condition for truth or description.</p>
			<p><strong>Instrumentalized Χ (paper-internal):</strong> distance is used as a control technique (e.g., demanded calmness to erase <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> or to avoid <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> work), rather than as restraint.</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification (consistency):</strong>  </p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Χ as restraint:</strong> self-applied braking that protects revision and dignity.</li>
				<li><strong>Χ as domination:</strong> other-applied braking demanded to preserve leverage or erase Λ.</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Non-equivalence note:</strong><br>Χ (distance) does not add information and does not create awareness.
				It modulates <strong>binding validity</strong>, not option visibility.
			</p>
			<h3>16.17 Dignity-in-Practice (D)</h3>
			<p><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> denotes a validity constraint for handling <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> under binding.</p>
			<p><strong>Paper-standard form (constraint notation):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice) = Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment) ∘ Χ (distance: reflective inhibition) applied to Ω (asymmetry) handling</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Discipline (non-moral):</strong>
				D is not a moral ranking of persons. It specifies that binding and coordination remain compatible with restraint (<strong>Χ</strong>) and self-adopted commitment (<strong>Ψ→Self</strong>), rather than enforced capture (<strong>Ψ→Other</strong>) or standing degradation.
			</p>
			<h3>16.18 Recontextualization (Φ)</h3>
			<p><strong>Φ (recontextualization: frame shift / narrative embedding)</strong> denotes post-hoc frame shifts that change how events are interpreted inside <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Functional Φ (paper-internal):</strong> helps adapt meaning without erasing coordination requirements.</p>
			<p><strong>Control-surface Φ (paper-internal):</strong> substitutes for repair; narrative embedding is used to avoid <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> while stabilizing standing operations.</p>
			<p><strong>Consistency note:</strong>
				Φ is not inherently “bad”; it becomes drift-relevant when it repeatedly replaces Σ and converts Λ into “already solved.”
			</p>
			<h3>16.19 Attractor (Α)</h3>
			<p><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization / script formation)</strong> denotes the stabilization of repeatable protocols that keep a configuration durable over time <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Protocolization (paper-internal):</strong> when a sequence becomes reliable and self-reinforcing (for example: denial → reframe → residue leverage → devaluation), <strong>Α (attractor)</strong> is said to be high.</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>
				Α describes <em>repeatability</em>, not “intention.” A pattern can stabilize without anyone “wanting” it.
			</p>
			<h3>16.20 Negative Responsibility Kernel (NRK)</h3>
			<p><strong>NRK (negative responsibility kernel)</strong> is a <strong>paper-internal composite / pattern label</strong>, not a PMS operator (NRK is not listed as an operator in PMS.yaml).</p>
			<p><strong>NRK (structural definition):</strong>
				NRK names a breach type in which enactment occurs <strong>within</strong> a scene where awareness and alternatives are structurally available, while the carrying operators for integrated reciprocity do not carry enactment.
			</p>
			<p>A compact form used in this paper:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>NRK = enactment under ∇ (impulse) within □ (frame) with A (awareness: [Θ, □, Δ]) available, while Σ (integration) is low/failed and/or Ψ (self-binding) is absent/aborted/externalized/simulated.</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Discipline (E separation):</strong>
				NRK does not imply <strong>E (action)</strong>. NRK is precisely a case where realization occurs without integrated enactment (Σ-carriage), and may involve Ψ failure or Ψ→Other externalization.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification (avoid misread):</strong>
				“Negative” here is formal (absence of carrying operators), not moral negativity.
			</p>
			<h3>16.21 Reciprocity</h3>
			<p><strong>Reciprocity</strong> is not symmetry. It is <strong>coordinated asymmetry</strong>:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Reciprocity = Σ (integration: coherence synthesis) under Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance), bound by Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment), limited by Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong></li>
			</ul>
			<p>Reciprocity requires <strong>Ω-legibility</strong> (asymmetry nameable), active <strong>Σ</strong> (coordination synthesis), anchored <strong>Ψ</strong> (durable commitments), and present <strong>Χ</strong> (escalation brake).</p>
			<h3>16.22 Devaluation</h3>
			<p><strong>Devaluation</strong> (paper-internal) denotes lowering standing-in-practice as a control move inside a frame <strong>□ (frame)</strong>, often used as a substitute for coordination when <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> is blocked and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> cannot bind to explicit role-responsibility.</p>
			<p>Devaluation is treated structurally as a stabilization technique, not as a claim about inner motives.</p>
			<p><strong>Clarification:</strong>
				Devaluation can occur through explicit ranking, insinuation, withdrawal of recognition, or “frame verdicts,” depending on □.
			</p>
			<h3>16.23 Regime and Meta-Frame</h3>
			<p>A <strong>regime</strong> (paper-internal) is a <strong>stable meta-frame configuration</strong> that persists across scenes and makes a drift repeatable by shaping what is speakable, coordinable, and sanctionable in <strong>□ (frame)</strong>.</p>
			<p>A regime is detected by:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>chronic constraints on Ω-legibility (<strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> taboo or illegibility),</li>
				<li>elevated reliance on <strong>Φ (recontextualization)</strong> and <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> as control surfaces,</li>
				<li>suppressed consolidation of <strong>Σ (integration)</strong> and explicit <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>,</li>
				<li>stable scripts via <strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong>.</li>
			</ul>
			<h3>16.24 Tragedy, Loss, and Degradation</h3>
			<p><strong>Tragedy</strong> (paper-internal) denotes a <strong>structural probability of mutual losses</strong> when the operators required for stable coordination are blocked (notably <strong>Ω-legibility</strong>, <strong>Σ (integration)</strong>, and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>), and residues accumulate across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> with chronic <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong>.</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Loss (paper-internal):</strong> a reduction of available coordination channels, standing-in-practice, or reversibility capacity caused by operator constraints across time <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Degradation (paper-internal):</strong> deterioration of dignity-in-practice constraints when <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is handled without restraint from <strong>Χ (distance)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong>.</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<p><strong>Consistency note:</strong>
				“Loss” is a change in available channels; “degradation” is a change in validity constraints (D) during Ω handling; “tragedy” is the emergent trajectory probability when these accumulate under Θ with chronic Λ.

			<h2>17. Alternative Explanations (Methodological Discipline Box)</h2>
			<p>This subsection lists <strong>alternative sufficient explanations</strong> for the observed drift logic in PMS–EDEN. It is included as a <strong>methodological discipline</strong>: the model’s regime-description is not treated as the only possible generator.</p>
			<p>No refutation is attempted. No ranking is implied. No preference is signaled.</p>
			<p><strong>Scope note (discipline):</strong>
				Each AE is <strong>sufficient</strong> (could generate similar observables) but not asserted as “true.” Their purpose is to prevent over-claiming and to preserve multi-causality discipline.
			</p>
			<p><strong>Role-discipline note (wording):</strong>
				Alternative explanations are stated in <strong>role/gradient language</strong> (Ω-capacity/exposure/leverage positions) rather than group labels. Any everyday categories (e.g., gender-coded roles) are treated only as <strong>possible correlates</strong> of Ω-visibility in a given scene, not as explanatory primitives.
			</p>
			<h3>AE1 — Drift without regime (pair-dynamics under comparison frame □)</h3>
			<p><strong>Claim:</strong> A full regime layer is not required. The drift can arise from local pair-dynamics once a <strong>comparison-dominant □ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> becomes stable.</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal operator configuration (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> shifts to comparison-as-orientation</li>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient)</strong> becomes salient in consequences</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> remains low/failed</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> remains weak/misbound</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event: structured absence / non-closure)</strong> accumulates across <strong>Θ (temporality: trajectory/time)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor: pattern stabilization)</strong> stabilizes recurring scripts</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Interpretation (plain language):</strong>
				Comparison framing alone can generate permanent monitoring, correction pressure, and pseudo-symmetry drift, even if no meta-frame regime (like PFO) is present.
			</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>AE2 — Drift via Ω overextension (salient Ω-carrier → counter-control)</h3>
			<p><strong>Claim:</strong> The genesis impulse can begin from the <strong>higher-leverage / more Ω-salient role-position</strong> when <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural imbalance)</strong> is enacted as overextension (capacity/leverage used beyond dignity constraints), triggering counter-control rather than coordination.</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal operator configuration (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> enacted as unilateral leverage (overextension)</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance: reflective inhibition)</strong> low/absent at the moment of leverage use</li>
				<li><strong>D (dignity-in-practice: restrained handling of asymmetry)</strong> violated (Ψ/Χ restraint missing)</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> shifts to comparison/tribunal mode as defensive response</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> increases (repair/recognition/coordination missing)</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes counter-control scripts</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> remains blocked; <strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> externalizes into demands (Ψ→Other)</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Interpretation (plain language):</strong>
				Drift can originate in <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> mis-handling (overreach) by the <strong>salient Ω-carrier</strong> (the position whose capacity/leverage is most consequence-visible in that scene), where the response becomes <strong>frame-control</strong> rather than Σ-based coordination.
			</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>
			<h3>AE3 — Drift without humiliation (exit / isolation as stabilization)</h3>
			<p><strong>Claim:</strong> Devaluation-based stabilization is not required. The system can stabilize drift by <strong>exit</strong> or <strong>isolation</strong> rather than status regulation via devaluation.</p>
			<p><strong>Minimal operator configuration (readable):</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> salient but not coordinable</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> low/failed (interfaces not built)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> collapses or becomes minimal/individual (bindings withdrawn)</li>
				<li><strong>Χ (distance)</strong> increases as withdrawal rather than reflective coordination</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> becomes chronic (repair missing, recognition missing)</li>
				<li><strong>Θ (temporality)</strong> locks the separation trajectory</li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes avoidance/exit as the default script</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Interpretation (plain language):</strong>
				Instead of stabilizing through devaluation, the configuration stabilizes by reducing contact, reducing mutual obligations, or ending reciprocity attempts.
			</p>
			<p>This describes a <strong>structural consequence</strong>, not a moral judgement, intention, or blame attribution.</p>

			<h2>18. Boundary Conditions of PMS–EDEN</h2>
			<p>This section defines where PMS–EDEN applies weakly, partially, or not at all. The purpose is <strong>scope discipline</strong>, not concession.</p>
			<p><strong>Consistency note (application discipline):</strong>
				Boundary conditions constrain <em>explanatory force</em> (how strongly the drift grammar applies), not <em>moral valence</em> (which is excluded by design).
			</p>
			<h3>18.1 Ω minimal or absent</h3>
			<p>If <strong>Ω (asymmetry: structural capacity/exposure/obligation gradient)</strong> is minimal, absent, or not action-relevant in consequences, then key drift mechanisms (comparison pressure, pseudo-symmetry stabilization, devaluation-as-residue) lose their primary generator.</p>
			<p><strong>Implication:</strong> PMS–EDEN’s asymmetry-driven traces (Ω→□comparison→pseudo-symmetry→devaluation→reciprocity loss) apply only partially.</p>
			<h3>18.2 □ not comparison-based</h3>
			<p>If the dominant <strong>□ (frame: contextual constraint)</strong> is praxis-coordination rather than comparison/tribunal, then false equivalence maintenance costs and pseudo-symmetry attractors are less likely to stabilize.</p>
			<p><strong>Typical forms:</strong></p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□praxis</strong> remains dominant (tasks/interfaces first)</li>
				<li><strong>□comparison</strong> does not become the governing relevance grammar</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Implication:</strong> dissatisfaction-as-system-cost from false equivalence is reduced; Σ-work can remain accessible.</p>
			<h3>18.3 Σ/Ψ established early and robust</h3>
			<p>If <strong>Σ (integration: coherence synthesis into coordinated praxis)</strong> and <strong>Ψ (self-binding: durable commitment across time)</strong> are established early—before chronic <strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> accumulates across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong>—then reciprocity can stabilize even under real <strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong>.</p>
			<p><strong>Implication:</strong> the drift sequence is interrupted upstream; pseudo-symmetry need not form as a stabilizer.</p>
			<h3>18.4 External institutions stabilize roles</h3>
			<p>If external institutions (norms, contracts, role systems, shared governance structures) stabilize obligations and interfaces, they can substitute for missing internal stabilization:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> is constrained externally (relevance and sanction structures are not fully negotiable)</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> can be scaffolded by enforceable commitments</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> can be supported by predefined interfaces</li>
			</ul>
			<p><strong>Implication:</strong> regime-like drift becomes less likely because coordination does not depend exclusively on local narrative control or informal leverage.</p>
			<h3>18.5 Summary condition (operator-readable)</h3>
			<p>PMS–EDEN drift claims apply most strongly when:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><strong>Ω (asymmetry)</strong> is action-relevant and legible in consequences</li>
				<li><strong>□ (frame)</strong> becomes comparison-dominant and constrains Ω speakability</li>
				<li><strong>Σ (integration)</strong> remains low/blocked/suppressed</li>
				<li><strong>Ψ (self-binding)</strong> is absent/misbound/externalized</li>
				<li><strong>Λ (non-event)</strong> becomes chronic across <strong>Θ (temporality)</strong></li>
				<li><strong>Α (attractor)</strong> stabilizes repeatable scripts</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Where these constraints do not hold, PMS–EDEN applies weakly or only as partial analogy.</p>
