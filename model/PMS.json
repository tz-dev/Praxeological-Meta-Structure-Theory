    "description": "PMS (Praxeological Meta-Structure) is a generative operator framework for modeling praxis, asymmetry, development and self-binding. It defines eleven irreducible meta-axioms (Δ–Ψ) and specifies how complex structures such as awareness, coherence, responsibility, action and dignity-in-practice arise from operator compositions. PMS is a structural, non-phenomenological and non-clinical meta-model. Other models (e.g. praxeological action models) MAY be derived from PMS but are not part of this specification.",
